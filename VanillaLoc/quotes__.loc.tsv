quotes_quote_onscreen_4312	If we run, they will claw us into the dirt and their hounds will gnaw the gristle from our bones.

So many deaths. Which will we choose?	true
quotes_quote_onscreen_4612	Apparently, we fight with "peasants' weapons" and "without honour from afar". Whatever, I say, the results speak for themselves - they got chopped up and we reduced the Greenskins to a smelly puddle on the battlefield!	true

Our mine was saved - the Aircorp of Zhufbar had arrived!	true
quotes_quote_onscreen_4317	And so did the fair village of Sternburg come under the hateful, greed-filled gaze of the Beast. Intent these foul Beasts were of naught but the spilling of blood, the burning of houses and the butchery of all.

quotes_quote_onscreen_3876	No man is born so unnatural that his body does not revolt at the foul pollution of Undead blood. And by these marks can you tell them: by the fangs of the predator, for their thirst for blood and flesh is like that of a vile beast; by their porcelain white skin, cold to the touch and unnatural to the eye; by the glow of their eyes, behind which lives the terrible Hunger. These are the marks of the Vampire.	true

quotes_quote_onscreen_4742	To sail with a Black Ark is one of the greatest honours that any Druchii could ever aspire to. I trained long and hard to earn my berth upon the Wind of Damnation, slaying several undeserving rivals to the post along the way. It is a worthy life. I get to regularly practice my skills upon our many enemies and one tenth of the plunder that I seize is mine to keep. Slaves, gold, and fame, these too can be yours if you are bold.	true
quotes_quote_onscreen_4343	All around me, they are talking, whispering. Put out their eyes, pluck out their filthy tongues, still they talk, always taunting. Braying in the fields, they plot, they approach in the night, drawing always nearer. They come!	true

quotes_quote_onscreen_4449	And I beheld a great host descending; a horde of bodies, not one of them complete. An arm missing here, a leg there, a jaw elsewhere; a desiccated mass of horror, tumbling from the mountainside…	true
quotes_quote_onscreen_4749	You were so magnificent when I found you, the biggest in your litter, and they were all large before you ate them. I raised you, I fed you the best Dwarf-meat and Man-flesh. And you have become even more magnificent. Such courage. There is none other like you, Queek. You are unnaturally brave. Others think you freakish for leading from the front, not the back. But I do not. I am proud of my Queek.	true

quotes_quote_onscreen_4352	And then, the Beastmen were upon us - breaking apart our cannons like they were matchwood. As you can imagine, we ran, lest the disgusting mass consumed us. Only Sigmar knows how we made it to safety, but some were not so nimble in their escape, and paid - screaming - with their lives.	true
quotes_quote_onscreen_4552	There are many who would defile the sanctity of the forest. Dwarfs avariciously crave our sacred timber, while wizards would siphon the energies of our life. All will be expunged. Athel Loren will be defended.	true

quotes_quote_onscreen_4653	Their slinking, furred shapes infested the broken city, feasting on the fallen and pulling down the weak... The manlings stood back to back and fought for their lives, but against the implacable ferocity and countless numbers of the verminous horde their weapons were useless. The tide of monstrous rats flowed over them one by one, dragging them down to be torn apart, the yellow chisel-teeth sinking into their soft flesh, the dark-furred mass drowning their pitiful screams with their hideous chattering.	true

quotes_quote_onscreen_4251	I looked up into the sky and there I saw my doom, lithesome yet dread. What creatures were these? How many tortures would I endure before peace was mine?

quotes_quote_onscreen_4551	All tunnels lead to Skavenblight.	true
quotes_quote_onscreen_4456	What fools we were. In pride we built Eight Peaks, sure of our mastery of stone and the dark beneath the world. Yet even as we built the city, the seeds of its doom were planted.	true
quotes_quote_onscreen_4656	Bretonnia is a realm of men, but 'twould be nothing without the steeds that carry them.

quotes_quote_onscreen_4157	Typical Goblin weapon, a great bouncing mouth that will eat anything it happens to land on. No subtlety to it, no innovation, no invention. Still, a crossbow bolt or two will see to them alright.	true
quotes_quote_onscreen_4354	Never have I seen such a heaving mass of tusk and flesh, appearing as if from nowhere and careening towards us with truly wild abandon. We had no chance, and I am only alive to speak of it because - to my eternal shame - I ran like a craven coward from the slavering herd.	true

quotes_quote_onscreen_4455	At the zenith of our ancient power, it was a wonder to the world; more beautiful then even Everpeak, open to the sky. A sign of our wealth and power, strong beyond the measure of all. We thought it would never fall and the mines would be ours forever...	true
quotes_quote_onscreen_4555	Warboss Grak Beastbasha of the Red Snakes tribe was once visited by a vision from Gork (or possibly Mork) that inspired him to lead a horde of more than five thousand sun-crazed Savage Orcs in a march through the jungle to claim the ruins of the temple-city of Itza Chiquita. On their way, they were regularly waylaid, led into the pathway of hunting monsters, and picked off mercilessly by poison darts. It took only seven Chameleon Skinks to ensure that not a single Greenskin from that formidable horde survived. Such are the dangers of Lustria....	true

quotes_quote_onscreen_4482	When we first came here we numbered five hundred, with a few mannish allies. The only perils we faced were the Orcs and their followers. We cleared this keep and parts of the upper city as a prelude to reclaiming our ancient mines.	true
quotes_quote_onscreen_4582	Manlings don’t like it, but I find a good squeeze of rats’ blood into the hair and beard keeps the Skaven’s noses confused. Long enough for you to get your axe into their brains, anyway.	true

quotes_quote_onscreen_3880	Fear me, mortals, for I am the Anointed, the Favoured Son of Chaos, the Scourge of the World. The armies of the Gods rally behind me, and it is by my will and by my sword that your weakling nations shall fall.	true
quotes_quote_onscreen_4680	The weak Elves of Ulthuan fear us, for our ways are the true ways. They fear what they cannot understand and instead cower behind the lies of their false history.

quotes_quote_onscreen_4587	Leave tunnels for the Dwarfs, manlings, or at least take one of us with you if you must go down below. You’ll only get lost down there alone. And there are more horrors in the dark than just the Skaven, trust me.	true

quotes_quote_onscreen_3688	Hold back your fire and let us pass. We have taken the Slayer's Oath and would pit our axes against those beasts. If we come back, have all your ale ready.

quotes_quote_onscreen_4592	I take offence at that. Our weapons may not be quite as deadly to our enemies, but that doesn’t mean that our engineering is lesser than the Skaven's. For my money, when a weapon explodes in your hands more often than at the enemy, it’s not much of a weapon at all. Right?	true
