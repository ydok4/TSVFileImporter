It infuriated them that the gods had seen fit to only grant them just a few short decades upon the world to make their mark and none rankled under that knowledge more than the Great King Settra.

Despite having conquered all Nehekhara and ensuring that much of Khemri was made in his image, Settra was obsessed with not just creating a legacy, but outliving it. And so he ordered the Mortuary Cult formed – its purpose to discover the ultimate secret: to cheat death. The Priesthood of the Mortuary Cult was led by Khatep, an extremely gifted and wise seer. It was Khatep who tended to Settra’s dying mortal form and promised the Great King that he would rise again on the Day of Awakening. As the years past, the hieratic cult’s quest for lore was partially successful. The priests themselves learnt how to sustain a form of Unlife, their spirits tethered to their desiccated bodies, yet the knowledge to bring back the kings as eternal demi-gods still lay beyond their grasp. However, they were undeterred and their search continued, all while serving their living kings as advisors and viziers. Thus, the Mortuary Cult spread across Nehekhara.

The arrival of the Arch-Necromancer changed everything. Following the casting of Nagash’s Great Ritual, civil war threatened Nehekhara and Khatep took it upon himself to restore order. He broke open the seals to Settra’s Grand Pyramid, which caused the Great King to rise, filled with an unquenchable wrath. However, Settra had not risen as a beatific sovereign but as a ravaged mummy – this was not the Day of Awakening promised by the Mortuary Cult! Settra raged and banished Khatep from Khemri.

To this day Khatep the Liche Lord remains the nominal head of the Mortuary Cult; since his exile he wanders the world, at first restricted to roaming Nehekhara's vast deserts, but of late he has travelled further afield, gathering followers and fellow exiles to seek out the lost lore he hopes will return the Lands of Nehek to glory and rehabilitate his reputation as their saviour!	true

 Bretonnia is the second largest nation of men after the Empire. It is located to the west of Sigmar’s lands, separated from them by the Grey Mountains. The two nations trade via several critical mountain passes and on the whole relations remain cordial, although they have gone to war many times in their turbulent history. Bretonnia is a feudal society, split between the savagely poor majority and the rich nobles with their gallant Knights standing above the filthy rabble. In theory, the Knights of Bretonnia - the flower of its military - have a code of chivalry that forms an unbreakable duty to protect its citizens. In practice, Knights are often selfish, greedy, political creatures, more interested in procuring the shiniest armour and attending tournaments than safeguarding the basic needs of the smallfolk. However, when the Knights of Bretonnia do go to war they are undeniably proficient and considered by many to be the most powerful heavy cavalry in the Old World – although no doubt the Knightly Orders of the Empire would contest this! Then there are the Grail Knights, who have supped from the holy chalice and become more than mortal, to the point where earthly desires such as wealth and political aspirations matter little, if at all. All they care about is the chivalric code, in the truest sense of the word. However, a Bretonnian army rarely consists of Knights alone ranks of solid, if unremarkable, foot troops and peasant levies are provided to soak up damage from unchivalrous cannons and other ranged devices. Although the Knights are only too happy for their own side to field large trebuchets, they would never dirty their own hands in such cowardly ways.

The current King of Bretonnia is Louen Leoncoeur, a Grail Knight of course, and considered by many of his subjects to be the nation’s greatest ruler since Gilles Le Breton – ‘the Uniter’ of legend. Renowned far beyond Bretonnia’s borders as its ‘Lionhearted’ King, some say that Gilles’ noble blood runs in his veins, so great is his stature and skill in all areas of Kingship. Far more than a mere Knight, King Louen is also known as a wise and just monarch, as well as a fine diplomat who acts fairly and honourably no matter the situation. On the battlefield he truly is a fearsome opponent and the slayer of Greenskins, Beastmen, and just about any other invader who dares cross into Bretonnian territory with evil intent! And so it is that the Knights of Bretonnia march forth – led by their courageous warrior-King – with lances dipped, and a prayer to the Lady on their lips!	true

start_pos_factions_long_description_1880659197	In the Land of the Dead, no name is more hated than Nagash the Arch-Necromancer, architect of Nehekhara’s downfall. It was he that cast a great ritual and brought all the dead back to Unlife ahead of the promised Day of Awakening. Centuries before this epochal moment, he had ruled Khemri, stealing the kingship from his younger brother.

Arkhan was the most loyal of Nagash’s followers, pivotal in the coup that brought the nascent Necromancer to power. After his lord, Arkhan was the first to imbibe the Elixir of Life, thereby transitioning from mere mortal to Unliving immortal. For decades, Arkhan remained staunchly loyal to Nagash; a great warrior and general, he was also an accomplished student of dark sorcery thanks to his master's teachings. After fifty years of rule, the other cities of Nehekhara revolted against Nagash – desperate to end his malicious reign. The Army of the Seven Kings besieged Khemri, and Nagash was forced to retreat. Arkhan held back the allied Priest Kings’ legions through feats both martial and arcane. He finally fell, not to some hero’s blade but an ordinary spear thrown by a nameless soldier. By his dying breath he cursed both the spear and any that desecrated his corpse.

Nagash has returned to enact vengeance on Nehekhara several times over the centuries. One of the Arch-Necromancer's first acts was to resurrect his faithful lieutenant. And so Arkhan the Black, the Liche King, rose from the dead, as loyal as always and a key figure in Nagash’s many machinations. In an age of comets and new empires, Nagash remains adrift from the world… for the moment. But he is very much active. Arkhan's Black Tower a beacon for those who worship the Arch-Necromancer as a god-in-waiting. Naturally, his greatest rival – everyone's greatest rival no less – is Settra the Imperishable. The two have fought dozens of times; although Arkhan’s forces cannot rival Settra’s legions, neither can the Imperishable overcome the Liche King’s dark sorcery. Thus, their wars end in stalemate, and only when Arkhan utters false promises of fealty does Settra return satisfied to Khemri. Such false servitude cannot – will not – last, for while there is still a chance to resurrect Nagash, his loyal servant will take it.	true

Long ago, Queen Neferata stole the secrets of eternal life from Nagash. The elixir she created was flawed, bestowing immortality but at great cost. And so the Vampires were created and they have been a plague upon the living ever since.

Millennia later and the darkling figure of Vlad von Carstein arrived in Sylvania - a backwater region within the Stirland province of the Empire. Soon the whole of Sylvania's destitute nobility was in his thrall; the von Carstein bloodline was born. For years, the Vampire Counts of Sylvania kept their Undying existence a deathly secret. The region’s pathetic peasants and the neighbouring lords had their suspicions but nothing was proven until Vlad revealed himself in full lifeless glory at the head of an Undead host. His desire was nothing more than the throne of the Empire.

Vlad was slain at the Siege of Altdorf, the Undead army withered and his Vampire sires fled back to Sylvania, which was known to be a cursed land, tainted by perpetual death for evermore. Whilst Vlad’s bid for a vast Undead empire failed, he did start a pattern that would repeat itself several times over the coming centuries. A von Carstein would take the reins of power within Sylvania and inevitably strike out against the living at the head of an Unliving army – power-hungry Necromancers, Zombie hordes, ranks of Skeletons, tomb-skulking Crypt Ghouls and bestial Varghulfs are just some of the nightmares a Vampire Lord can summon to his indomitable will.

Vlad may have been the first of the von Carstein line, but Mannfred was equally feared - he also came close to despoiling the Empire, being finally brought to bay at Hel Fenn and slain. But what is no longer living is never easy to kill; both Vlad and Mannfred have risen again. The dead have never rested easily in Sylvania and now they lurch from their graves, summoned to Unlife by the Midnight Aristocracy as each prepares to challenge mankind once more. Both believe they are the rightful, Eternal Emperor; the usurper, Karl Franz, will learn this at great cost - and all the living will pay tribute to the von Carsteins’ Unholy Majesty!	true

Orcs and Goblins are the scourge of the Old World. Collectively known as Greenskins, they are an aggressive and brutal race with an unquenchable love of fighting. For most nations, war is a means to an end - an act of aggression to conquer and dominate an enemy. However, the Greenskins - and the Orcs in particular - revel in battle purely for the sake of it. Orcs are built for violence - brutal, bullying creatures of jutting jaws and hulking appearance. The Goblins, by contrast, are smaller but more cunning as they mob-up in greater numbers. This motley cast is supported by a fell menagerie of other creatures from wolves to Trolls, monstrous spiders to lumbering Giants.

Yet it’s the Orcs that dominate - their violent temperament keeping them top of the Greenskin tree. Orc attacks range from raids to a mighty Waaagh! where Greenskins of all stripes congregate in their tens of thousands under a single leader, who they believe has been chosen by Gork (or Mork) - the fickle gods of Orc-dom - to lead the mighty green tide on a rampage across the world. It is the Waaagh! that the other, weaker, races fear the most, as once an Orc Warboss gains enough momentum his horde can only ever be stopped at great cost. The Empire is a common target - having been ravaged countless times by many an infamous Waaagh! throughout history. Yet it is the Dwarfs that harbour a special hatred of Orcs and their despicable kin, as the Dawi have lost many of their legendary strongholds to Greenskin incursions.

While the Greenskins have made lairs in ransacked Dwarfen Holds, they can be found across the world - the majority residing in the arid Badlands, mainly fighting amongst themselves and occasionally coming together as a greater threat. Now such an occasion is upon us, for Grimgor Ironhide comes south. Goaded by Gorfang Rotgut, the boss of Black Crag, Ironhide marches with his Black Orcs. Once Black Crag is his, surely the Badlands will follow? And then the rest of the Dwarf realms shall fall to his ever-growing Waaagh!, all while the Empire and the other humie realms burn. This is what Gork and Mork demand; please them and ensure the mobs shout the name "GRIMGOR" for the rest of time!   	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120136365	Although many Greenskin tribes reside in the Badlands to the south, since the calamitous defeat of the Dwarfs in the wake of the Time of Woes, Orcs and Goblins have developed a taste for the “fine livin’” to be found within the Dwarfholds – specifically the abundance of “shiny fings” piled high in the halls beneath.

Now, the sneakiest Night Goblin, Skarsnik, self-styled ‘Warlord of the Eight Peaks’, hunts his prized Squigs in the Grey Mountains. Once he learns that mutinous gits from within his own tribe have betrayed him and taken the Eight Peaks for themselves there will most certainly be trouble of the psychotically-violent kind; Skarsnik’s Waaagh! is truly something to behold, or avoid if you’re on the opposing side! This is what Gork and Mork – da Green Godz – demand of their servants, and only total victory will satisfy their bloodlust!	true

Although sometimes appearing cruel, in reality they are a neutral power who act only to maintain the balance of their environment. Elves are not just long-limbed, they also live for thousands of years, which naturally makes other races seem trivial and irrelevant; only the preservation of their forest home matters, everything else – the affairs of mere ’mayflies’ – is of little importance or consequence to them

Although incursions are driven back, there are constant threats to the Wood Elves’ forest home and way of life. In order to combat Athel Loren’s many foes, they have developed elite warriors and can call on the forest itself in its defence. In addition to this martial strength, beneath the forest floor lie the Worldroots, enabling subterranean travel; Elven armies – led by their perennial King in the Woods, Orion – emerging to surprise and defeat those who encroach upon Athel Loren’s glades and boughs uninvited…	true

One such occasion is now; Wurrzag – aligned with the Orcs of the Bloody Handz tribe, who seek the greatness they believe ‘Da Great Green Prophet’ can bring them – is abroad, and has wandered into the Dragonback Mountains in search of more than just plunder and the inevitable scrap to get his filthy green hands on it.

Wurrzag desires greatness for all his kind – for Greenskins to go beyond being merely an avaricious rabble and “reach for da skies”. This will bring his force into conflict with other, potentially-sneakier Greenskins, plus bands of humies, stunties, and whatever-else dares get in their way. War is exactly what da Green Godz – Gork and Mork – want; they want it bloody and climactic, and they want it right now!

Dwarfs are a proud, bearded folk who are quick to temper and easy to offend, with a love of gems, gold and other precious metals. They are short, generally no taller than five-and-a-half foot in height but are broad with powerful arms and stout legs. Dwarfs are master craftsmen; they see the work of other races as inferior and even have a special word in their lexicon for man-made devices which they call "umgak", to mean shoddy. Much of this learning has come from eons of carving out their homes in the mountains; the strongholds under the World's Edge Mountains were undisputable wonders of the world - massive underground cities known as ‘Holds’, and in the lower levels great industrial centres in the form of smelteries, forges and mine works digging ever deeper into the roots of the mountains.

With their Dwarfholds established across the World's Edge Mountains and far beyond, the Dwarfs prospered for many generations. But then came the War of the Beard, a devastating continent-spanning conflict with the High Elves. This decimated the Dwarf Empire, leaving the network of Holds weak. Then their realm was riven by a chain of devastating earthquakes; that’s when the Goblins and other things struck. The Dwarfs' true enemies were revealed to be the devious Goblins, who had for so long coveted their grand halls. Thus the golden age of Karaz Ankor - ‘The Everlasting Realm’ in the Dwarfish tongue of Khazalid - ended.

In recent times, the Dwarfs are a race barely holding onto glories past, with only a few strongholds remaining in their hands and the rest lost to enemies or abandoned to the elements.

To this day the Dawi – as they call themselves - still fight; their ultimate goal is to restore their empire. With their belligerence, such a thing is possible. A Dwarf army or ‘throng’, is a powerful force, consisting of stoic Warriors and using wonders of technological accomplishment that put all other races to shame. Gyrocopters and Gyrobombers fly above the battlefield while cannons fuelled by flame and steam spew death. Dwarfs do not call upon the Winds of Magic in the same way as Elves or men. To them, magic is a tangible thing, something that can be worked into axes, stone or even cannonballs. This is rune magic and Runesmiths, the masters of the art, are adept at creating arcane devices and weapons of great power.

It is with all these elements - stalwart Dwarfish hearts, exceptional armour and weaponry, and their unmatched machines of war - that High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer plans to retake his realm, slaying every last stinking Greenskin in his way! Few doubt his resolve, and for the first time in many generations, the Dwarfs are truly roused to battle - the Great Reckoning begins!	true

For two and a half millennia the Empire has formed a bulwark against the encroaching forces of destruction. Lying at the heart of the Old World, it is the greatest and most powerful of all the nations forged by Men. But the realm is in constant turmoil, beset on all sides by enemies ferocious and foul - despised by countless foes, with even gods and their unholy followers desiring nothing more than the Empire's utter destruction.

Yet it endures, for mankind has a steely determination to not merely live, but thrive. The Empire’s armies are mighty with ranks of highly-disciplined troops and heavily-armoured Knights, led by valiant warrior-generals and supplemented by the arcane will of Battle Wizards and powerful machines of war.

While the Empire’s vast armies are constantly caught in the swirling maelstrom of war, facing all manner of threats within and without its porous borders, perhaps its greatest foe is, and always has been, itself. For the Empire is not one harmonious nation but a collective of fiercely independent provinces and city-states each led by an Elector Count – a powerful noble whose own interests often come before matters of his people or the greater good of the nation. It is from these men and women that an Emperor is elected; in the past the realm has been blighted by a succession of corrupt leaders, or been riven with internal strife as rival Electors fought for the throne. During such dark times the Empire was at its weakest and so its many enemies have taken full advantage.

And yet when mankind seems in greatest peril, the Twin-Tailed Comet arcs across the sky and a great leader comes to the fore. First it was Sigmar, the Warrior-God that founded the Empire, and in recent centuries Magnus the Pious purged the lands of Chaos, uniting the nation under one glorious banner. But that was five hundred years ago. A new Emperor has been crowned, he is untested, unwilling - as yet - to take up Sigmar’s Warhammer, and not the candidate many Elector Counts wanted. They are uneasy, fractious and, in some cases, outright hostile - and at a time when dark clouds gather in the north, the dead walk again in Sylvania, ancient allies are under siege, and the Greenskins are more belligerent than ever.

So begins the age of Karl Franz, and he has much to do: unite the Empire, secure its borders and bring prosperity to its beleaguered citizens. The Twin-Tailed Comet blazes across the sky once again, but is this an omen for good or ill?	true

For many generations the Dwarfs prospered. But then their realm was riven by a chain of devastating earthquakes followed by sustained attacks by Greenskins and other vile foes. Thus the golden age of the Karaz Ankor ended.

As ever, the Dwarfs’ reason for existence is to take back what is rightfully theirs and right the many wrongs recorded in the Great Book of Grudges. One such grudge is against that fiendish Night Goblin, Skarsnik, who will dominate Karak Eight Peaks unless challenged.

As you might expect, Belegar Ironhammer – direct descendant of the legendary King Lunn – has taken this slight very personally indeed, and intends to set the record straight once and for all. In fact, so large a stain was the loss of Vala-Azril-Ungol upon the pride of Clan Angrund, that Belegar’s ancient Ancestors refuse to rest until they have done their part to aid him in reclaiming the pivotal fortress for Clan Angrund and wiping out every nasty little green git who dares stand in his way. 

A tall order? Not really – Belegar has bolstered his army with a force of Rangers and some extremely serious hardware for smashing and bashing and flying his way to victory. That ought to do it, but if it doesn’t he’ll shave his beard off and join the Slayers!

The flora itself is sentient - capable of thought and emotion - and fully entwined with the forest in such a way that only death can separate them. The forest spirits view the outside world and its inhabitants with great suspicion. Outsiders, on the other hand, consider such things to be creatures of myth. How wrong they are! In many ways, the Treemen are the forest, embodying its spirit like no others.

Forest spirits are fierce in battle, filled with the wrath that only centuries of anger at deliberate trespass and incursion can generate. Despite this, they feel warmth towards the ‘lesser’ creatures of the forest, and as such the Wood Elves have long been accepted within their woodland home. The last of the Ancients – the mighty Durthu – and his kin live within the bounds of the Elven High Realm of Argwylon, a special place where magic is everywhere.

The pitiless and Chaos-ravaged lands north of Kislev are home to nomadic tribes of half-starved men who scratch a desperate living from the barren soil, and plagued by roving bands hunting for Chaos-warped beasts - but this place truly belongs to the Trolls. Nearer Kislev, River and Stone Trolls roam freely, but farther north Chaos has warped the inhabitants. Trolls are large, vicious and dumb at the best of times, and thanks to the influence of Chaos, many have taken on grotesque mutations, becoming bigger, more brutal, and even more mindless.

Yet, there are exceptions. Whilst Throgg, King of the Trolls, enjoys rending and devouring his enemies as much as any of his brethren do, he is surprisingly smart. He was given the name Wintertooth by the warriors of the Old World, thanks to his unfailing ability to despatch any champion they sent to fight him. But, whether due to a quirk of nature or to the touch of Chaos, Throgg is not just a fearsome brute but a creature of cunning and guile. After countless years facing constant needling from the lands of men, he sees what must be done. Vowing to take the fight south, Throgg brings Chaos and destruction to those who dared to goad him, in the name of all Trollkind.	true

start_pos_factions_long_description_2120138512	The Skaven are the ratmen gnawing at the roots of the world – an evil and conniving race that outnumber all their enemies. If only they could stop squabbling and backstabbing for long enough, and join together in one mighty alliance, then all their enemies would be wiped out under a furry tide of screeching vermin.

But that is not how the Skaven think. Betrayal, duplicity, and cowardice are the true marks of the Skaven, and in many parts of the Under-Empire such traits are lauded as virtues. Clan Rictus vaunts these qualities – they are extremely rich, with treasure holds said to rival even those of Clan Mors. Rictus dominates the passages and tunnels under Crookback Mountain, a nest-lair deep in the Dark Lands to the east of the World's Edge. However, of late their focus has been pulled far to the west…

Tretch Craventail has no right to the title of Grand Chieftain of the Deep Warrens, and yet, none answer to it but he. The wretch has risen quickly through the ranks of Clan Rictus on a mixture of luck and outright, unashamed treachery. However, no Skaven can survive on luck alone, and so Tretch is also one of the most conniving and cruel ratmen to have lived in recent times. He has developed – or it was within him all along? – an absolute knack for knowing when lethal trouble is close. It’s at these times that Craventail will mysteriously disappear, leaving whichever retinue he was 'leading' to their inevitable fate.

But despite such a 'boon' – whether a natural talent or a gift from the Horned One himself – Tretch has finally come to the attention of Clan Rictus’ leader, Lord Kratch Doomclaw, a sitting member of the Council of Thirteen. Doomclaw has ordered Tretch lead a Clan Rictus expedition to the Elf-thing lands of Naggaroth, far to the west of Crookback Mountain. It is unclear exactly what Lord Kratch’s motives are but they're probably not altruistic in nature – maybe a play for power using his most capable Chieftains, or a way to rid himself of an annoying and potential rival? Most probably, it is both...	true

These Ruinous Powers have many mortal worshippers, most of which hail from the far north of Norsca and beyond. Their armies are legion, made up of barbarous Chaos Marauders and Chaos Warriors - particularly ruthless and bloody fighters gifted with arcane suits of all-encompassing armour, accompanied by a mass of mind-fraying creatures. These hordes can be raiders that cross the icy seas in longships, large armies that raze entire cities, or full-scale invasions where entire nations quake in fear, convinced the End Times are upon them… And quite possibly they are, for now is the time of the Three-Eyed King.

start_pos_factions_long_description_2120137303	“Life is a cancer, but I have the cure - death everlasting…”

Long ago, Queen Neferata stole the secrets of eternal life from Nagash. The elixir she created was flawed, bestowing immortality but at great cost. And so the Vampires were created and they have been a plague upon the living ever since.

Millennia later and the darkling figure of Vlad von Carstein arrived in Sylvania - a backwater region within the Stirland province of the Empire. Soon the whole of Sylvania's destitute nobility was in his thrall; the von Carstein bloodline was born. For years, the Vampire Counts of Sylvania kept their Undying existence a deathly secret. The region’s pathetic peasants and the neighbouring lords had their suspicions but nothing was proven until Vlad revealed himself in full lifeless glory at the head of an Undead host. His desire was nothing more than the throne of the Empire.

Vlad was slain at the Siege of Altdorf, the Undead army withered and his Vampire sires fled back to Sylvania, which was known to be a cursed land, tainted by perpetual death for evermore. Whilst Vlad’s bid for a vast Undead empire failed, he did start a pattern that would repeat itself several times over the coming centuries. A von Carstein would take the reins of power within Sylvania and inevitably strike out against the living at the head of an Unliving army – power-hungry Necromancers, Zombie hordes, ranks of Skeletons, tomb-skulking Crypt Ghouls and bestial Varghulfs are just some of the nightmares a Vampire Lord can summon to his indomitable will.

Vlad may have been the first of the von Carstein line, but Mannfred was equally feared - he also came close to despoiling the Empire, being finally brought to bay at Hel Fenn and slain. But what is no longer living is never easy to kill; both Vlad and Mannfred have risen again. The dead have never rested easily in Sylvania and now they lurch from their graves, summoned to Unlife by the Midnight Aristocracy as each prepares to challenge mankind once more. Both believe they are the rightful, Eternal Emperor; the usurper, Karl Franz, will learn this at great cost - and all the living will pay tribute to the von Carsteins’ Unholy Majesty!	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120137456	Much of the Old World is covered in dark, forbidding forest. Although mankind has claimed this land, to think the forests are tamed would be a mistake - for they are the blood-grounds of the Cloven Ones. Beastmen are creatures of Chaos, so civilisation is anathema to them and they raid and destroy all that they come across. Mankind has retaliated, but bringing a warherd to battle is hard. Beastmen are master ambushers, using the beast-paths to entrap an enemy army - the hunter quickly becoming the hunted.

Even when battle is joined, Beastmen are ferocious foes - mighty Beastlords control herds of goat-headed Gors, smaller Ungors strike from the flanks, and frenzied, massive Minotaurs charge at any enemy line. Then there are the many monsters in thrall to their bestial masters: Chaos Spawn, Warhounds, Giants and Cygors to name but a few. Such a fearsome menagerie is partly why the Old World's forests are still terrifying places, where the Children of Chaos roam, lurking in the darkness, desperate to pull apart the very fabric of civilisation.	true

The Lady of the Lake is the principle Bretonnian deity, said to embody the pure, noble, courageous spirit for which the Kingdom is known. Her earthly representative is the Fay Enchantress, who watches over Bretonnia from her tower in Carcassonne and upon whose wise counsel King Louen depends. In fact, during times of dynastic crisis, the Enchantress is empowered to choose the next Royarch from amongst the Dukes and has, on at least one prior occasion, stripped a tyrannical or cruel ruler of his throne and commanded his own Knights to forcibly expel the oppressor from the kingdom! Whilst undoubtedly ancient – some say thousands of years old even – the Enchantress appears to all as a beautiful young woman and is reincarnated instantly as soon as her host body wears out. Although undoubtedly a fearsome sorceress more than capable of defeating her enemies by herself, the Fay Enchantress is served by her loyal body of Grail Knights, whose lives are sworn to protect her person and obey any and all commands. She is also served by the Damsels and Prophetesses of the Lady, who are called into her service as children and become her acolytes, eventually having not insignificant magical powers of their own.

The Enchantress is the one who rouses the usually competitive dukedoms of Bretonnia into united action when the kingdom is threatened by evil forces from without. It has even been known, at times of mortal peril, for her to ride into battle ahead of an army of her fiercely-loyal Grail Knights. On the battlefield, she uses magic to both protect Bretonnian forces from attack or weaken and strike down the foe – sometimes with a single, furious stare!	true

Yours is the scurrying of badgers, the flight of the starlings, but without meaning. You are never still, never at peace. Always taking without thought, never giving back."

Athel Loren is more than a mere forest; it is a living force whose spirit inhabits both the creatures that dwell there and its plant life also. The flora itself is sentient - capable of thought and emotion - and fully entwined with the forest in such a way that only death can separate them. The forest spirits view the outside world and its inhabitants with great suspicion. Outsiders, on the other hand, consider such things as Dryads and Treemen creatures of myth, either long-dead or only existing in legend. How wrong they are! In many ways, the Treemen are the forest, embodying its spirit like no others, and never leaving it unless forced to do so. Naturally cautious, they will only join battle when no other choice is presented, but can command other forest-dwellers to their will and advantage when fighting.

At war, forest spirits are fierce, almost impossible to kill, and filled with the wrath that only centuries of anger at careless trespass and deliberate incursion can generate, ensuring that any who face them and live to tell the tale remain reluctant to return to Athel Loren ever again. Despite this aggression, Treemen feel warmth towards the ‘lesser’ creatures that live around them. Although not indigenous to the forest, the Wood Elves have long been accepted within their beloved woodland. However, even the extremely long lives of the Elves appear to be as fleeting as the seasons to the forest spirits, many of whom can still recall the times before they settled and made homes within its boughs and glades.

The last of the Ancients – the mighty Durthu – and his kin live deep within Athel Loren, inside the bounds of the Elven High Realm of Argwylon. Also known as the ‘Moonspring Glades’, Argwylon is a special place, where magic is everywhere and within every living thing. There the forest spirits and Wood Elves co-exist peacefully, coming together during times of threat and turmoil to put those foolish enough to invade their sacred home to ignominious flight or certain, screaming death!	true

The harsh and brutal nature of the far north is reflected in the grim character of its peoples. Yet even more than the privations of their cold and barren lands, their proximity to the Realm of Chaos shapes the Norsca and other northern tribes. Rather than fight the darkness, they embrace it, worshipping the forces of Chaos as Gods, providing a willing army for the Ruinous Powers' never-ending war against order and reason.

Though physically tougher and more powerful than those living an easier life in the south, the Northmen are still Men - although many of them will have their humanity warped by mutations, and their savagery and barbarism are legendary. War is their natural state, and whether raiding across the Sea of Claws in their longships or feuding with neighbouring tribes, their blades never go long without blood. They follow the Ruinous Powers with unquestioning fervour, personifying them as the Hound, the Crow, the Serpent and the Eagle. They need no priests to intercede with their Gods, believing the slaughter and terror they bring is an act of worship in itself, though they are also highly superstitious and often raise twisted shrines and make blood offerings to honour whichever deity they hope to win favour with. The shared ambition of every northern warrior is to cause the greatest possible bloodshed and mayhem in order to appease and please their Gods; in seeking this goal most die violent deaths, or fall into warped insanity, but a few become favoured as Champions of the Gods, often 'blessed' with mutations such as a melding of flesh and armour, or weapons fused with the hands that wield them.

No single Lord holds sway over the nomadic northern tribes, although men and monster alike are increasingly drawn to fight for King Throgg, a Troll of surprising intellect, or to follow Wulfrik the Wanderer, a Norscan warrior cursed by the Gods to forever seek out and fight the mightiest opponents. And whenever the Ruinous Powers prepare for a new assault on the south the Northmen put aside their petty disputes and rivalries and unite behind their Champions, ready to fight and die in the name of their Gods. At times like this, the Realm of Chaos itself swells and expands, bleeding over into mortal lands. One day, the Norsca believe, their advance will not be checked, and Chaos will swallow the world.	true

To this day the Dwarfs still fight; their ultimate goal is to restore their empire. With their belligerence, such a thing is possible. A Dwarf throng is a powerful force, consisting of stoic Dwarf Warriors, Gyrocopters that fly above the battlefield and cannons fuelled by flame and steam that spew death. Dwarfs do not call upon the Winds of Magic in the same way as men. To them, magic is a tangible thing, something that can be worked into axes or cannonballs. It is with all these elements - stalwart Dwarfish hearts, exceptional armour and weaponry, and the unmatched machines of war - that High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer plans to retake his realm, slaying every last stinking Greenskin in his way! Few doubt his resolve and for the first time in many generations the Dwarfs are truly roused to battle - the Great Reckoning begins!	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120135926	For two and a half millennia the Empire has formed a bulwark against the encroaching forces of destruction. But the realm is in constant turmoil, beset on all sides by enemies ferocious and foul. Yet it endures, for mankind has a steely determination to not merely live, but thrive. The Empire’s armies are mighty, large regiments of disciplined troops led by valiant warrior-generals and supplemented by the arcane will of Battle Wizards, as well as powerful machines of war.

A new Emperor has recently been crowned, but he is untested, and not the candidate many Elector Counts wanted - and at a time when dark clouds gather in the north. So begins the age of Karl Franz, and he has much to do: unite the Empire, secure its borders and bring prosperity to its beleaguered citizens. The Twin-Tailed Comet blazes across the sky once again, but is this an omen for good or ill?	true

start_pos_factions_description_2120136329	As ever, the Dwarfs’ reason for existence is to take back what is rightfully theirs and right the many wrongs recorded in the Great Book of Grudges. One such grudge is against that fiendish Night Goblin, Skarsnik, who will dominate Karak Eight Peaks unless challenged.

As you might expect, Belegar Ironhammer – direct descendant of the legendary King Lunn - has taken this slight very personally indeed, and intends to set the record straight once and for all. In fact, so large a stain was the loss of Vala-Azril-Ungol upon the pride of Clan Angrund, that Belegar’s ancient Ancestors refuse to rest until they have done their part to aid him in reclaiming the pivotal fortress for Clan Angrund and wiping out every nasty little green git who dares stand in his way.

A tall order? Not really – Belegar has bolstered his army with a force of Rangers and some extremely serious hardware for smashing and bashing and flying his way to victory. That ought to do it, but if it doesn’t he’ll shave his beard off and join the Slayers! Mark Belegar’s words, o green tide, and mark them well; the Karaz Ankor will return, with Belegar Ironhammer at its vanguard!	true

 Orcs and Goblins are the scourge of the Old World. Collectively known as Greenskins, they are an aggressive and brutal race with an unquenchable love of war. Orcs are built for violence – brutal, bullying creatures of jutting jaws and hulking appearance. The Goblins, by contrast, are smaller but more cunning as they mob-up in greater numbers.

Although many Greenskin tribes reside in the Badlands to the south, since the calamitous defeat of the Dwarfs in the wake of the Time of Woes, Orcs and Goblins have developed a taste for the “fine livin’” to be found within the Dwarfholds – specifically the abundance of “shiny fings” piled high in the halls beneath.

 Now, the sneakiest Night Goblin, Skarsnik, self-styled ‘Warlord of the Eight Peaks’, hunts his prized Squigs in the Grey Mountains. Once he learns that mutinous gits from within his own tribe have betrayed him and taken the Eight Peaks for themselves there will most certainly be trouble of the psychotically-violent kind; Skarsnik’s Waaagh! is truly something to behold, or avoid if you’re on the opposing side! This is what Gork and Mork – da Green Godz – demand of their servants, and only total victory will satisfy their bloodlust!	true

start_pos_factions_long_description_2120137564	"Athel Loren shall not suffer the presence of Men, nor Orcs, nor Dwarfs, nor Beastmen. If a foe takes a single step upon such sacred soil, they shall not take another."

The Wood Elves are a race of tall, slender humanoids who live within the sacred woodland of Athel Loren, the most ancient forest in the Old World. Their home is a carefully-balanced ecosystem, one where the trees themselves truly live and are hostile to the avaricious intentions of outsiders. As you might expect, the Wood Elves – or Asrai as they call themselves – are a mysterious race who rarely emerge from the forest and are generally only seen when coming to its defence. Although they can appear cruel, in reality the Asrai are a neutral power who act only to maintain the balance of their environment, however such actions are interpreted by others. Elves are not just long-limbed, they also live for thousands of years, which naturally makes other races seem trivial and irrelevant; only the preservation of their forest home matters, everything else – the affairs of mere ’mayflies’ – is of little importance or consequence to them.

The Elven race first left their island home, Ulthuan, many centuries ago following attacks by the forces of Chaos that led to the death of the legendary Phoenix King, Aenarion. In doing so, they became masters of shipbuilding and sea travel long before such secrets were revealed to other races. Although many colonies were founded, the most suitable for the Asrai was beneath the boughs of ancient Athel Loren. So in touch with their woodland home were the Wood Elves, so well did they thrive in perfect isolation, that when the Phoenix King demanded they return to fight in Ulthuan’s defence, they refused! However, the Asrai’s secluded existence was doomed not to last.

Although regular incursions by the Beastmen of Chaos are driven back, their Ruinous threat is fierce and constant. In order to combat them and other foes, and to defend the forest’s flora and fauna, the Wood Elves – led by their perennial King in the Woods, Orion – have developed elite warriors; the swift and deadly Glade Guards; the unique, beguiling and deadly Wardancers; magic-using Spellsingers, and archers mounted on giant Warhawks can all be brought to bear in defence of Athel Loren. In addition to this martial strength, beneath the forest floor lie the Worldroots, enabling the Asrai to travel underground and emerge in great numbers to surprise and defeat those who encroach upon Athel Loren’s glades and boughs uninvited…	true

start_pos_factions_long_description_2120136466	"I spent three years in Duke Alberic’s household. Hated every single second of it. But you know, no opponent scares me now."

Bordeleaux is one of the founding Dukedoms of Bretonnia, occupying the western coastal region just south of cursed Mousillon. The current Duke is the courageous yet stern Alberic, known for his strict adherence to the rules of chivalry and the preservation of the natural order. Knights trained under Alberic are among the very best Bretonnia has to offer, showing almost suicidal levels of bravery on the battlefield – never shrinking from an opponent, no matter their size or reputation. Duke Alberic’s coat of arms bears the distinctive Trident of Manann, the Sea-God, who watches over Bordeleaux’s coastlines and vies with the Lady of the Lake for the affections of its people, such is his importance in the region. Certainly, along the sea routes and among sea-borne traders, Manann is considered the more popular patron-god. Legend has it that Alberic’s ancestor, Duke Marcus – one of the original Companions of Gilles the Uniter – himself fought alongside the temperamental Sea God; apparently, the pair expelled raiders from Bordeleaux’s coastlines together, restoring peace and allowing trade to flourish once again unhindered.

Duke Alberic's bravery and strict self-discipline is well known, and naturally he expects his Knights to reach the same high personal standards, even going so far to dismiss and expel those who err or fail to meet them. This means that Alberic has the smallest Ducal household in the Kingdom, but one that is nevertheless a force to be reckoned with and containing some of Bretonnia’s greatest Knights. Unfortunately, circumstance has thus far prevented Alberic from achieving his life’s ambition – to embark upon a Grail Quest. For this to happen, a suitable successor must be found so that Bordeleaux may continue to flourish in his absence. Despite his advancing years, the duke remains hopeful that a candidate may yet emerge, enabling him to leave his ancestral seat and search for the holy chalice of legend in the Lady’s blessed name!	true

Traditionally, the Greenskins wander the Badlands as individual tribes, only coming together when the call to Waaagh! goes out. One such occasion is now; Wurrzag is abroad – aligned with the Orcs of the Bloody Handz tribe, who seek the greatness they believe ‘Da Great Green Prophet’ can bring them – and has wandered into the Dragonback Mountains in search of more than just plunder and the inevitable scrap to get his filthy green hands on it. 

Wurrzag desires greatness for all his kind – for Greenskins to go beyond being merely an avaricious rabble and “reach for da skies”. This will bring his force into conflict with other, potentially-sneakier Greenskins, plus bands of humies, stunties, and whatever-else dares get in their way. War is exactly what da Green Godz – Gork and Mork – want; they want it bloody and climactic, and they want it right now! And who is Wurrzag – most pious of all Orcs - to go against the word of da Godz? Exactly. Waaagh!	true

Much of the Old World is covered in dark, forbidding forest - vast tracts of dense woodland where thick canopies blot out the sky and you can walk for days on end without seeing the sun. Assuming, of course, you could wander for so long in such a place and survive intact. Although mankind has ruled this land for many centuries, to think the forests tamed simply by being within the borders of the Empire or Bretonnia would be a mistake. Despite countless pogroms to clear the woodlands of their sinister taint, they have always harboured evil. The dark forests are not the homes of man, they are the blood-grounds of the Cloven Ones.

When Morrslieb's glow penetrates the dense boughs of the wild woods, the Beastmen range. They hunt the blood-grounds for prey - be that rival herds, 'natural' fauna or, more preferably, man-flesh. It is mankind that the Beastmen seem to despise the most, although they have a long and bitter rivalry with the Wood Elves and will happily feast on Dwarfen flesh when the opportunity arises. To the Beastmen, though, men represent everything they hate. Despite the dangers around it, mankind has prospered, building great cities where the trees part, creating order and civilisation. Beastmen are creatures of Chaos, they follow the Ruinous Powers and so civilisation is anathema to them. They have a burning desire that floods their entire being: to tear down progress and society wherever it is found. And so they raid, destroying the easier targets - hamlets and villages that dare to exist close to the blood-grounds. Should a brayherd be gathered, when the Bray-Shamans manage to bring the fractious bestial tribes into one larger force, larger towns and even cities are attacked. Thankfully for mankind, and other ordered races, this is a rare occurrence. 

The Empire and its occasional allies have retaliated, but bringing a Beastmen warherd to battle is hard. They are master ambushers, using the beast-paths to weave around and entrap an enemy army - the hunter quickly becoming the hunted and facing doom. Even when battle is joined the Beastmen are ferocious foes - mighty Beastlords control herds of goat-headed Gors, smaller Ungors strike from the flanks and frenzied, massive Minotaurs charge at any enemy line. Then there are the many monsters in thrall to their bestial masters: Chaos Spawn, Warhounds, Giants and Cygors to name but a few. Such a fearsome menagerie is part of the reason why the Old World's forests are still terrifying places, where the Children of Chaos roam, lurking in the darkness, desperate to pull apart the very fabric of civilisation.	true

If only they could stop squabbling and backstabbing for long enough, and join together in one mighty alliance, then all their enemies would be wiped out under a furry tide of screeching vermin.

But that is not how the Skaven think. Betrayal, duplicity, and cowardice are the true marks of the Skaven, and in many parts of the Under-Empire such traits are lauded as virtues. Clan Rictus vaunts these qualities – they are extremely rich, with treasure holds said to rival even those of Clan Mors. Rictus dominates the passages and tunnels under Crookback Mountain, a nest-lair deep in the Dark Lands to the east of the World's Edge. However, of late their focus has been pulled far to the west…

Tretch Craventail has no right to the title of Grand Chieftain of the Deep Warrens, and yet, none answer to it but he. The wretch has risen quickly through the ranks of Clan Rictus on a mixture of luck and outright, unashamed treachery. However, no Skaven can survive on luck alone, and so Tretch is also one of the most conniving and cruel ratmen to have lived in recent times. He has developed – or it was within him all along? – an absolute knack for knowing when lethal trouble is close. It’s at these times that Craventail will mysteriously disappear, leaving whichever retinue he was 'leading' to their inevitable fate.

But despite such a 'boon' – whether a natural talent or a gift from the Horned One himself – Tretch has finally come to the attention of Clan Rictus’ leader, Lord Kratch Doomclaw, a sitting member of the Council of Thirteen. Doomclaw has ordered Tretch lead a Clan Rictus expedition to the Elf-thing lands of Naggaroth, far to the west of Crookback Mountain. It is unclear exactly what Lord Kratch’s motives are but they're probably not altruistic in nature – maybe a play for power using his most capable Chieftains, or a way to rid himself of an annoying and potential rival? Most probably, it is both...	true

Both believe they are the rightful, Eternal Emperor; the usurper, Karl Franz, will learn this at great cost - and all the living will pay tribute to the von Carsteins’ Unholy Majesty!	true

start_pos_factions_long_description_2120135948	“Fear me, mortals, for I am the Anointed, the Favoured Son of Chaos, the Scourge of the World.”

To explain Chaos is to define the undefinable; it permeates the world - the ultimate foe against which the forces of Order must battle to survive. Chaos - and all magic, for that is of Chaos - seeps into the world from the two poles, one of which lies at the Realm of Chaos in the far north. This is the legacy of the Old Ones, an ancient star-faring race who, in their arrogance, used the immaterial dimension to travel and manipulate the tangible. Unknown to them, the empyrean was home to the sub-conscious desires, aspirations and emotions of all sentient races. Over time, this force coalesced into the Chaos Gods – the Ruinous Powers. It is these omnipotent beings that control the fates of all, viewing the world as a game board, the mortal denizens on it as nothing more than playing pieces to be pushed aside and destroyed at will. The Chaos Gods have many names and aspects. For most in the Old World who are aware of such things they are Khorne - the Blood God, Lord of Murder, Rage, Violence and Battles; Tzeentch - the Arch-Manipulator, Master of Magic and Weaver of Time; Nurgle - the Lord of Decay, Father of Plagues, Poxes and Contagions; Slaanesh – the Dark Prince of Chaos, the Great Summoner of Excess, Desire and Perversion.

To the north of the Old World lies Norsca and beyond that the Chaos Wastes, which lie in the shadow of the Chaos realm - its people the Gods’ primary pawns. The Northmen congregate in tribes. They are savage and brutal, for the lands are harsh, full of ice-covered fjords and roving monsters. No crops grow here so they must raid south to survive. They do this not just out of necessity but for glory and the chance to be recognised by the Chaos Gods. Those that do well will be gifted with all manner of mutations, and for the very few, even Daemonhood. However, those that disappoint the Ruinous Powers will be turned to Chaos Spawn - mewling mountains of flesh, teeth and tentacles.

And so Chaos armies march south, consisting of Chaos Marauders, the aforementioned fur-clad barbarians, and Chaos Warriors - particularly ruthless fighters chosen by the Ruinous Powers and gifted with arcane suits of all-encompassing armour. A Chaos force is also accompanied by a mass of mind-fraying creatures – from Hellcannons to Dragon Ogres and abhorrent Spawn. These hordes can be raiders that cross the icy seas in longships, large armies that raze entire cities, or full-scale invasions where entire nations quake in fear, convinced the End Times are upon them… And quite possibly they are, for now is the time of the Three-Eyed King. Archaon the Everchosen gathers his countless servants, who are ready at their Lord’s whispered command to bring doom down upon all!	true

start_pos_factions_long_description_681358391	Beyond the Badlands lies the Land of the Dead. This desert realm is the cradle of mankind’s earliest empire – a civilisation known as Nehekhara that did not just huddle the banks of the Great Vitae River, but straddled the mountains to reach the shores of the Bitter Sea.

To the east, it was dominated by the cities of Lahmia, Mahrak and Lybaras – ruled by great matriarchs. Even so, Khemri remained its greatest prize. When Nagash, the Arch-Necromancer, was defeated by the Army of the Seven Kings, High Queen Neferata of Lahmia acted quickly, even as the alliance dissipated. In secret, she stole the forbidden lore of Nagash to recreate the Elixir of Life. But Neferata’s own concoction was flawed – it did indeed extend her life, but the cost was an unyielding thirst for blood. Neferata had unwittingly created a race that would blight all the world forever more, she became the first Vampire.

By the time her cousin, Khalida of Lybaras, visited for a great feast, most of the Lahmian Court were infected with Vampirism. To display her new found power, Neferata challenged her cousin to ritual combat in front of all in attendance. The two women fought before the shocked nobility, their blades weaving a deadly and delicate dance. But Neferata was no longer a mere mortal, and so bested her cousin. As Khalida lay dying, Neferata let her own cursed blood infect the Lybaran queen, as a final, spiteful act. The Warrior-Queen cried to the gods in desperation, and one answered! The Asp-Goddess heard Khalida's pleas and purged the taint from her veins, at the cost of her life. Khalida’s body was borne back to Lybaras in sorrow, where she was embalmed and placed upon her throne, ready to defend her city and godly patron from behind the wall of death.

When the Tomb Kings finally awoke from their breathless sleep, Khalida remained on her throne, uninterested in the power-grabbing and politicking of these Undying tyrants. However, when Lybaras is threatened, Khalida acts, and quickly. At Asaph's bidding, she silently rises from her throne and commands her loyal legions to march forth. Khalida fights not merely out of loyalty to the goddess who aided her, she harbours a deep, eternal loathing – not just for her cousin, but all Vampires who dare cross her path.	true

start_pos_factions_long_description_203769664	In the Land of the Dead, no name is more hated than Nagash the Arch-Necromancer, architect of Nehekhara’s downfall. It was he that cast a great ritual and brought all the dead back to Unlife ahead of the promised Day of Awakening. Centuries before this epochal moment, he had ruled Khemri, stealing the kingship from his younger brother.

Arkhan was the most loyal of Nagash’s followers, pivotal in the coup that brought the nascent Necromancer to power. After his Lord, Arkhan was the first to imbibe the Elixir of Life, thereby transitioning from mere mortal to Unliving immortal. For decades, Arkhan remained staunchly loyal to Nagash; a great warrior and general, he was also an accomplished student of dark sorcery thanks to his master's teachings. After fifty years of rule, the other cities of Nehekhara revolted against Nagash – desperate to end his malicious reign. The Army of the Seven Kings besieged Khemri, and Nagash was forced to retreat. Arkhan held back the allied Priest Kings’ legions through feats both martial and arcane. He finally fell, not to some hero’s blade but an ordinary spear thrown by a nameless soldier. By his dying breath he cursed both the spear and any that desecrated his corpse.

Nagash has returned to enact vengeance on Nehekhara several times over the centuries. One of the Arch-Necromancer's first acts was to resurrect his faithful lieutenant. And so Arkhan the Black, the Liche King, rose from the dead, as loyal as always and a key figure in Nagash’s many machinations. In an age of comets and new empires, Nagash remains adrift from the world… for the moment. But he is very much active. Arkhan's Black Tower a beacon for those who worship the Arch-Necromancer as a god-in-waiting. Naturally, his greatest rival – everyone's greatest rival no less – is Settra the Imperishable. The two have fought dozens of times; although Arkhan’s forces cannot rival Settra’s legions, neither can the Imperishable overcome the Liche King’s dark sorcery. Thus, their wars end in stalemate, and only when Arkhan utters false promises of fealty does Settra return satisfied to Khemri. Such false servitude cannot – will not – last, for while there is still a chance to resurrect Nagash, his loyal servant will take it.	true

The harsh and brutal nature of the far north is reflected in the grim character of its peoples. Yet even more than the privations of their cold and barren lands, their proximity to the Realm of Chaos shapes the Norsca and other northern tribes. Rather than fight the darkness, they embrace it, worshipping the forces of Chaos as Gods, providing a willing army for the Ruinous Powers' never-ending war against order and reason.

Though physically tougher and more powerful than those living an easier life in the south, the Northmen are still Men - although many of them will have their humanity warped by mutations, and their savagery and barbarism are legendary. War is their natural state, and whether raiding across the Sea of Claws in their longships or feuding with neighbouring tribes, their blades never go long without blood. They follow the Ruinous Powers with unquestioning fervour, personifying them as the Hound, the Crow, the Serpent and the Eagle. They need no priests to intercede with their Gods, believing the slaughter and terror they bring is an act of worship in itself, though they are also highly superstitious and often raise twisted shrines and make blood offerings to honour whichever deity they hope to win favour with. The shared ambition of every northern warrior is to cause the greatest possible bloodshed and mayhem in order to appease and please their Gods; in seeking this goal most die violent deaths, or fall into warped insanity, but a few become favoured as Champions of the Gods, often 'blessed' with mutations such as a melding of flesh and armour, or weapons fused with the hands that wield them.

No single Lord holds sway over the nomadic northern tribes, although men and monster alike are increasingly drawn to fight for King Throgg, a Troll of surprising intellect, or to follow Wulfrik the Wanderer, a Norscan warrior cursed by the Gods to forever seek out and fight the mightiest opponents. And whenever the Ruinous Powers prepare for a new assault on the south the Northmen put aside their petty disputes and rivalries and unite behind their Champions, ready to fight and die in the name of their Gods. At times like this, the Realm of Chaos itself swells and expands, bleeding over into mortal lands. One day, the Norsca believe, their advance will not be checked, and Chaos will swallow the world.	true

start_pos_factions_long_description_902685778	In the land of Nehekhara, Khemri was the greatest city, ruled over by a dynasty of cruel kings and tyrants. While Nagash’s stolen rule of Khemri is indeed noteworthy, none – apart from the Arch-Necromancer himself – can question that its utmost reign came under High King Settra.

Before the wind of death ravaged Nehekhara, it was an impressive civilisation, a burgeoning realm of rival fiefdoms that saw mankind expand long before Sigmar was even born. But the curse of man, compared to Dwarfs and Elves, is their fleeting existence. Soon the kings and princes of the city-states became obsessed with death, with extending their meagre span. The Mortuary Cult was formed during Settra’s reign and charged with ensuring that mortal bonds would not halt his rule. Settra passed with a curse upon his lips, buried in a grand chamber beneath his mighty pyramid to await the Day of Awakening, when the Mortuary Cult will fulfil their promise and Settra will rise to rule Khemri and dominate all the kingdoms along the Great River Vitae once again. Only modest progress in extending life was made until the rise of Nagash, for it was he who was destined to become the first and greatest of all Necromancers – he who truly brought Unlife to the world.

The tale of Nagash is terrible to behold; needless to say, he was banished from Khemri – and thought destroyed – but many years later rose again and enacted his revenge on all Nehekhara. He cast a great ritual and all the dead in the city-states rose from their ageless slumbers. But this was not the glorious Day of Awakening promised by the Mortuary Cult. The kings awoke entombed in their sarcophagi, breaking free of their burial chambers they saw through empty eye sockets. They had not woken as gods, but were still the rotting mummies that had withered inside their tombs for countless centuries. Some went insane, others remain in denial, but a few were filled with rage at this betrayal. None more so than Settra.

Now Settra the Imperishable rules Khemri once more. His Undead legions march at his whim; the King of Kings will not rest until all are under his dominance, be they other, petty Tomb Kings, or the living, whom he despises, for they have something he can never again possess.	true

Long ago, Queen Neferata stole the secrets of eternal life from Nagash. The elixir she created was flawed, bestowing immortality but at great cost. And so the Vampires were created and they have been a plague upon the living ever since.

Millennia later and the darkling figure of Vlad von Carstein arrived in Sylvania - a backwater region within the Stirland province of the Empire. Soon the whole of Sylvania's destitute nobility was in his thrall; the von Carstein bloodline was born. For years, the Vampire Counts of Sylvania kept their Undying existence a deathly secret. The region’s pathetic peasants and the neighbouring lords had their suspicions but nothing was proven until Vlad revealed himself in full lifeless glory at the head of an Undead host. His desire was nothing more than the throne of the Empire.

Vlad was slain at the Siege of Altdorf, the Undead army withered and his Vampire sires fled back to Sylvania, which was known to be a cursed land, tainted by perpetual death for evermore. Whilst Vlad’s bid for a vast Undead empire failed, he did start a pattern that would repeat itself several times over the coming centuries. A von Carstein would take the reins of power within Sylvania and inevitably strike out against the living at the head of an Unliving army – power-hungry Necromancers, Zombie hordes, ranks of Skeletons, tomb-skulking Crypt Ghouls and bestial Varghulfs are just some of the nightmares a Vampire Lord can summon to his indomitable will.

Vlad may have been the first of the von Carstein line, but Mannfred was equally feared - he also came close to despoiling the Empire, being finally brought to bay at Hel Fenn and slain. But what is no longer living is never easy to kill; both Vlad and Mannfred have risen again. The dead have never rested easily in Sylvania and now they lurch from their graves, summoned to Unlife by the Midnight Aristocracy as each prepares to challenge mankind once more. Both believe they are the rightful, Eternal Emperor; the usurper, Karl Franz, will learn this at great cost - and all the living will pay tribute to the von Carsteins’ Unholy Majesty!	true

start_pos_factions_long_description_267521439	Even when they lived, the Tomb Kings of Nehekhara – or Priest Kings as they were – were obsessed with death. It infuriated them that the gods had seen fit to only grant them just a few short decades upon the world to make their mark and none rankled under that knowledge more than the Great King Settra.

Despite having conquered all Nehekhara and ensuring that much of Khemri was made in his image, Settra was obsessed with not just creating a legacy, but outliving it. And so he ordered the Mortuary Cult formed – its purpose to discover the ultimate secret: to cheat death. The Priesthood of the Mortuary Cult was led by Khatep, an extremely gifted and wise seer. It was Khatep who tended to Settra’s dying mortal form and promised the Great King that he would rise again on the Day of Awakening. As the years past, the hieratic cult’s quest for lore was partially successful. The priests themselves learnt how to sustain a form of Unlife, their spirits tethered to their desiccated bodies, yet the knowledge to bring back the kings as eternal demi-gods still lay beyond their grasp. However, they were undeterred and their search continued, all while serving their living kings as advisors and viziers. Thus, the Mortuary Cult spread across Nehekhara.

The arrival of the Arch-Necromancer changed everything. Following the casting of Nagash’s Great Ritual, civil war threatened Nehekhara and Khatep took it upon himself to restore order. He broke open the seals to Settra’s Grand Pyramid, which caused the Great King to rise, filled with an unquenchable wrath. However, Settra had not risen as a beatific sovereign but as a ravaged mummy – this was not the Day of Awakening promised by the Mortuary Cult! Settra raged and banished Khatep from Khemri.

To this day Khatep the Liche Lord remains the nominal head of the Mortuary Cult; since his exile he wanders the world, at first restricted to roaming Nehekhara's vast deserts, but of late he has travelled further afield, gathering followers and fellow exiles to seek out the lost lore he hopes will return the Lands of Nehek to glory and rehabilitate his reputation as their saviour!	true

start_pos_factions_description_488076414	The Norscans acknowledge no single ruler, but are united in their love of violence and the desire to spread the taint of Chaos. Constant war is a way of life, both between the feuding tribes and in raids against the 'soft' southerners who they view as a source of blood for their blades and plunder for their storehouses.

They aspire to attract the favour of their fickle Gods with acts of barbarism, in the hopes of receiving dark blessings, often in the form of grim mutations. The truly great became warped and mighty Champions. Most die violent deaths or degenerate into less-than-human monsters. When the Gods wax strong, the Norscan tribes unite under the banners of their Champions, and march south, eager to bring darkness and destruction to the world.	true
