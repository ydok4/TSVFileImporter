vo_fmv_texts_text_chs_rises	Can you feel it?  |From the north it comes.   |The tendrils of Chaos spread south, tainting the lands…  |And with it, the Warriors of Chaos march.  |We must ready ourselves, for war is coming!  |But who has brought the warring tribes together?  |What manner of champion holds that power?	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_skv_comet	It was the comet’s wake that weakened the Vortex. |Surely a cruel trick by the gods? |It’s not like mortal creatures could move a comet…	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_cst_wreck	The oceans roil constantly, shifting, concealing… Hiding secrets beneath their murky depths. |The living have no place in the dark deep of the sea. Only the dead can scavenge here.  |Wulfhart’s ship – a Vengeance left unfulfilled… but that was not all the captain left behind. |There it gleams, amidst the carcase of the ship. A harpoon of tempered star-metal. The only weapon strong enough to pierce the heart of Amanar. |The harpoon is claimed, but the charms that made it so potent have been washed away. |There is much to do before the weapon can be used against the beast.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_race_intro_wef_mini	The Deepwood stirs…  |The chill winds of Winter are past  |and the season of war is here!  |The Asrai are hunters  |and the forest is our home! |Woe betide those foolish enough to threaten it!  |There have been sacrifices…  |but we are ready… |He is ready!  |The Wild Hunt begins!	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_cst_items	The launcher has been constructed and Stromfels’ Lost Shanties have been sung. |The verses combining into a potent charm, imbuing the harpoon with great power. |The final verse revealing a cavern in the deeps where Amanar lurks.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_cst_battle	The chart is plotted and the sails billow as the ship follows the course revealed by the map. |The order is given "Drop anchor!".  |Your crew descends into the depths in search of the beast. |Amanar is close. The ancient Merwyrm roars. |In defiance or anguish? The predator is not used to the role of prey…|From the shadows comes another... to claim the prize of slaying Lothern's guardian beast.|Wulfhart's bane will become Fellheart's glory!|But you... are in his way.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_win_khalida	The Liche King is defeated.|His legions scattered like desert sands.|Now nothing can stand in your way,|all will bow to the majesty of Nehekhara!|The greatest of civilisations rises again,|the living will quail for the age of flesh is over.|The Tomb Kings shall reign over all!|The Black Pyramid is yours.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_race_intro_bst_mini	He tasks me.|Wolf Lord dares trespass on blood-grounds.|Drakwald mine!|Let him come find the One-eye.|He is prey - not hunter!|Cage them. Savour kill. Man-flesh!|Todbringer - he took eye; I take his corpse!	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_skv_intro	Deep under the world, they chitter and plan. |Watching. |Waiting. |When they emerge, it is a nightmare vision. |The Skaven, a ravenous horde of verminous ratmen. |They gnaw at the roots of the world like an infected wound. |They mean to rule over ruins, for such is the will of their god, the Great Horned Rat. |Only the island home of the High Elves has remained unscathed. |And at its centre, is the Great Vortex. |A swirling maelstrom that siphons Chaos from the world. |The Skaven covet its vast power with envious, beady, red eyes. |The Twin-tailed Comet is oft-seen as an omen, but this time its wake has disturbed the Winds of Magic. |In the secret halls of the Under-Empire, the Council of Thirteen has gathered. |A time to scheme, of opportunity. |I kill Dwarf-things in pillar-city! |No-No! Clan Mors go to Southlands, hunt for Warpstone. |Mors are puppet-minion! Pestilens infest Lustria! |Yes-yes, but all Warpstone for Council plan. |Come scribe-slave, work to do. Comet makes Elf-things weak. Council wants power of the Vortex. |Just as prophecy demands. |So it true. You read markings on the Black Pillar. |Then you know we must seek-find the Screaming One. Find out how to control the Vortex. |Oh-oh yes, master, but-but a large tribute of Warpstone will that Daemon require if-if we summon him-him. |Return to your assigned clan, harvest Warpstone. |Yes, most precipitous of masters. |And flay yourself for your impertinence. |Oh, it will be done your worshipness!	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_lzd_intro	Since the days of creation, the reptiles have dominated the jungle continent of Lustria. |The ignorant call the creatures "Lizardmen". |The wise know them as defenders of the world. |In ages past, the Old Ones had a plan. |But then the Stellar Gates collapsed, the Old Ones fled and Daemons flooded the mortal plane. |Led by the Slann, the Lizardmen fought the Daemons that surged across Lustria. |Yet, it was the Elves that created the Great Vortex. |A swirling maelstrom that siphoned the world of Chaos, withering Daemonkind. |The world was saved. |But the Vortex endures only because it is bolstered by the power of the Slann, via the Great Warding. |If the Warding should fail, the Daemons will return. |The forked-tongue of Sotek hangs low in the sky. |The Slann have felt it. Now I see it, brighter, clearer. |Its hiss disturbs the Winds of Magic. |Look, Tar-Grax, the sacred plaques. |One prophecy shines above all others… |Vortex of the warmbloods. |But the full meaning cannot be deciphered. If our master will not wake, we journey to the City of the Sun. |The Great Warding fails. The time of inaction is over! |We will find the missing plaques. Discover the lost secrets and reveal the true purpose of the Old Ones.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_hef_intro	Who are the Asur? |An enigma to men and Dwarfs who know them as High Elves. |At the centre of the Great Ocean lies Ulthuan, a paradise created by the Old Ones. |But when the stellar gates collapsed, Daemons flooded the mortal plane. |All was lost, until Aenarion the Defender strode forth. |The first Phoenix King vanquished the Daemons with the aid of the Archmage, Caledor Dragontamer. |It was Caledor and his Elven mages who created the Great Vortex. |A swirling maelstrom that siphoned the excess magic, withering Daemonkind. |With the world purged of Chaos, the Elves took it upon themselves to become guardians and stewards. |The Twin-tailed Comet is oft-seen as an omen. |But this time its wake brought great peril. |The Dragon with two tails flies lower than before. Its trail disturbs the Vortex. |I have felt a change in the Winds of Magic. |Then right it, brother. Lead the Mages of Saphery, bring all in the White Tower to bear if you must. |Such lore is currently beyond us. |I suggest a scrying ritual, in the Pool of Isha. It may provide us with the answer. |Such a ritual requires fragments of fallen Waystones. Far more than we have. |Then we find more. Make ready your ritual, Loremaster Talarian, you will have your fragments. |I shall start the search in Lustria. |Lustria? |My brother will search here, in Ulthuan. |Why do you care so much about the greater world? |Why do you not? |Stay here brother, protect Ulthuan, but I venture beyond our borders. |And while you meddle in far flung continents, I will ensure you have a home to return to!	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_def_intro	The world has seen countless murders. |But one killing stands above all others. One death that has shaped the world. |Malekith, son of Aenarion, was betrayed. The Elven princes crowned Bel Shanaar as the second Phoenix King. |So Malekith brooded and poured his hate into a single cup. |Malekith toasted Bel Shanaar, then stepped over his dying body... |...and into the sacred flame of kings.  |But the fires stripped his flesh, and with a final scream, he hurled himself back from whence he came. |His body was taken north and a suit of armour forged. |Malekith was reborn… |…the Witch King. |And in his shadow, legions raised. |Decades of civil war followed. |Then Malekith embarked on the most ruthless of plans. His Sorcerers would unbind the magic of the Great Vortex. |Created by Caledor Dragontamer and his Elven mages, the Vortex siphons the Winds of Magic, keeping the Daemon-tide at bay. |Malekith’s spell was flung at the Vortex. |But Caledor himself broke through the mists of time to deflect the titanic force back at its casters. |The Shadowlands were ravaged. Sundered! |You live. |You die. |You live. |You die. |Servants, you amuse me. |The Dragon with two-tails hangs in the sky, and you indulge in petty games. |You summoned me, your highness.  |You bring this witch here? |She is well versed in lore and prophecies. |She will betray you, my son, as all have done. |She is indebted to me. I have her soul. |Step forward, Felicion Heartkeeper. |The comet disrupts the Vortex. Whilst it is weak, a prophecy can be fulfilled. |Of a king who consumes the heart of Ulthuan. |My son will take its power, and our vengeance! |Find the Oracle, she knows what to do. |I am willing to serve, to earn my soul’s release.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_win_settra	The Liche King is defeated.|His legions scattered like desert sands.|Now nothing can stand in your way,|all will bow to the majesty of Nehekhara!|The greatest of civilisations rises again,|the living will quail for the age of flesh is over.|The Tomb Kings shall reign over all!|The Black Pyramid is yours.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_win_arkhan	Settra is defeated.|So much for the greatest of kings!|The way is clear, Liche King.|It is your right. Your destiny!|The Black Pyramid awakes.|But this is just the start.|The servant beckons the master…|Nagash shall come!	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_win_khatep	The Liche King is defeated.|His legions scattered like desert sands.|Now nothing can stand in your way,|all will bow to the majesty of Nehekhara!|The greatest of civilisations rises again,|the living will quail for the age of flesh is over.|The Tomb Kings shall reign over all!|The Black Pyramid is yours.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_lzd_horned_rat	The final piece of the puzzle, a relic to turn the cogs of the world and bring alignment lay beyond the great falls of Uztekko. |A key would be discovered. One to unlock knowledge both welcome and unwanted. |The fabric of reality was torn. From the Realm of Ruin, the Skaven’s Horned God mocked its prey and revealed his plan. |The celestial event that weakened the Vortex was of Skaven design, a parody of the true comet. |The Council of Thirteen, the ratmen’s highest authority were architects of this grand manipulation. |Its task complete and fuel expended, the rocket fell back to the surface. |When the wreckage was discovered, its purpose remained unclear, until now. |It was the catalyst to weaken the Vortex and goad the other races into action. |They knew the reptiles would seek to bolster the failing Vortex, but they were ready. |Every ritual cast the magic was stolen, absorbed into the Horned Rat’s Bell. |Now soaked in ritual power, the Bell will be moved to Ulthuan’s heart. |If it tolls thirteen times, the Horned God shall emerge from the Vortex, the world, doomed. |Then the God was gone. |Alignment is close, but Sotek’s nemesis may yet bring ruin upon us all!	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_battle_khalida	The fifth book - the Liber Necris...|...the final cyphers are revealed!|With five books in your possession,|the Black Pyramid shall open and your dominance assured.|Yet, the lackey of Nagash is in our way.|Undead legions muster in the shadow of the Black Pyramid.|Battle is inevitable.|Victory ensures your ever-living dynasty reigns supreme!	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_def_win	A Horned God banished. Vermin purged from the island’s shores. The Witch King has the prize. |Ulthuan and its Vortex are mine. |My son has his revenge. |And so the Vortex is ready to receive its Dark Elf master. A new era begins. |But there will always be enemies to fight and wars to wage!	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_hef_win	A Horned God banished. |Vermin purged from the island’s shores. |Ulthuan’s defenders are brothers-in-arms again. |And a hero… |… a Loremaster. One who has proven worthy of the Star Crown, to bear its power, walk into the Vortex and becalm the maelstrom. |Ours is a world of fleeting glory.| But it is glory nonetheless.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_hef_horned_rat	Aenarion the Defender, the first Phoenix King. |It is inevitable that the fifth and final shard of the Star Crown, is found upon the sword that doomed the Asur. |They were only here for the shard. |But even the Loremaster could feel the sword’s pull. |And then, something else touched their souls. |The fabric of reality was torn. From the Realm of Ruin, the Skaven’s Horned God mocked its prey and revealed his plan. |The celestial event that weakened the Vortex was of Skaven design, a parody of the true comet. |The Council of Thirteen, the ratmen’s highest authority, were architects of this grand manipulation. |Its task complete and fuel expended, the rocket fell back to the surface. |When the wreckage was discovered its purpose remained unclear, until now. |It was the catalyst to weaken the Vortex and goad the other races into action. |They knew the Asur would seek to bolster the failing Vortex, but they were ready. |Every ritual cast, the magic was stolen, absorbed into the Horned Rat’s bell. |Now soaked in ritual power, the bell will be moved to Ulthuan’s heart. |If it tolls thirteen times the Horned God shall emerge from the Vortex, the world, doomed. |Then the god was gone. |But, in its place came a swarm of his children. |Where there was two, there is now one. |But is that enough to make a difference?	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_race_intro_cst_cylostra	‘They’ say Wulfhart’s ship the ‘Vengeance’ is sunk. |Sixty cannons and two hundred souls… lost to the deep. |‘They say’ it was a fell storm that took her, or ‘some’ say it was pirates from the Maelstrom. |‘They’ say she was lost here… |…in the realm of Luthor Harkon, and to trespass in these waters is to invite death on board. |But then ‘They’ know nothing. |You waste our time.|Wait… This is the map you are looking for, crafted by Captain Jacob Wulfhart himself. I beg your patience, for its secrets are easily missed. |Math-lann-ca, sem-ca.|Witness Wulfhart’s obsession: a life spent chasing tavern stories and myth.|Sightings, eyewitness accounts, a hundred shipwrecks named and dated. |Like you, Wulfhart knew it was no storm or jagged rocks that caused their demise. |It was the Tidemaker, the ancient Myrwyrm; the Elves named it Amanar. |Wulfhart’s ship, where is it?|Ah yes, its final resting place. It was here he fought the beast. |A fight to the death. |All but one of his crew were lost. It was he who marked the map with this cross. |The ‘Vengeance’ lies here, and if the story runs true, a weapon lies with her. |A weapon to kill the ‘unkillable’.|To challenge the beast is to challenge the sea itself, cursing all that sail with its retribution. |Wulfhart sought infamy for killing the beast, but the question remains: |Why would your kind seek it? |Why all these stores?|We go hunt.|Yes! Hunt beast.|Oi, move barrels!|Get moving!|My lady, we have the map. What are your orders?|Kill the beast. Resurrect the beast. |Rule the waves.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_def_horned_rat	The fifth and final sacrifice was closest to the sorceress, both in bond and vicinity. |She named him brother, she named him Shadowblade! |But he was not the victim, he never was… |The betrayal amused one, who had watched from afar. |The fabric of reality was torn. From the Realm of Ruin, the Skaven’s Horned God mocked its prey and revealed his plan. |The celestial event that weakened the Vortex was of Skaven design. A parody of the true comet. |The Council of Thirteen, the ratmens’ highest authority, were architects of this grand manipulation. |Its task complete and fuel expended, the rocket fell back to the surface. |When the wreckage was discovered, its purposed remained unclear, until now. |It was the catalyst to weaken the Vortex and goad the other races into action. |They knew the Witch King would seek to dominate the Vortex, but they were ready. |Every ritual cast, the magic was stolen, absorbed into the Horned Rat’s bell. |Now soaked in ritual power, the bell will be moved to Ulthuan’s heart. |If it tolls thirteen times, the Horned God shall emerge from the Vortex, the world doomed. |While other races focussed on controlling the Vortex, the ratmen have been using a cursed bell to steal their ritual magic. |There’s no time for a murderer to grieve his sister.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_def_ritual_1	The ritual cast and magic bound within the scrolls of Hekarti was unleashed, lighting the dark skies of Naggaroth.  |The sorceress, Felicion, was joined by a murderer, one that hunted in the shadows. |They looked upon the island across poison shore and waited.  |Approaching the island was all but impossible. |Yet the ritual gave the sorceress ingress. |Felicion bargained with the Oracle. In exchange for her freedom, the Medusa bade the sorceress to look in the mirror. |At the heart of hated Ulthuan, the Vortex was vulnerable. |If the Witch King wished to step into the maelstrom and bathe in its power, then his body would need to be ready. |A drink from a cursed goblet was required. Filled with the lifeforce of five victims. |The rituals would reveal the prey that the sorceress and her assassin must hunt. |An irony that the Oracle was blind to her own fate. |Four more rituals, four more sacrifices needed to fill the goblet. Then the Witch King may drink and be ready to enter the Vortex. |More of Hekarti’s scrolls must be found.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_hef_ritual_1	The Way-fragments were gathered, the ritual cast. |Arcane power lit Ulthuan’s skies. |Loremaster Talarian, ally of Teclis, was joined by Galifreius, squire of Tyrion. |They would be the Prince’s eyes as the goddess Isha revealed her prophecy. |The Loremaster and squire saw the Isle of the Dead wreathed in fire. The Vortex gone. |Without the Vortex, Chaos floods the world, with Ulthuan doomed to sink beneath the waves. |But the Star Crown of Lileath has the power to restore it. |The crown was shattered long ago. If the lost shards are re-forged, Ulthuan can be saved. |Isha has blessed our agents with one piece of the Star Crown, but four shards remain lost. |Talarian suggests invoking the spirits of the Phoenix Kings, for who better than a king to find a crown? |The cost is high to cast such rituals, more Way-fragments are needed.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_def_ritual_3	The third victim was also known to the sorceress, but this was no enemy. |The pupil looked upon her teacher and saw the true cost of Dark Magic. |Success breeds expectation and the Witch King demands. |Especially when there are others who incite their own rituals of possession over the Vortex.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_hef_ritual_3	Bel-Korhadris, the scholar-king. |His knowledge bequeathed to those who searched. |Including where the third shard lay. |And how to slay the wyrm that hoarded it. |Begone servant of Chaos! Strike, Galifreius! |Time is against us, there are others that perform their own rituals of dominance over the Vortex.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_def_ritual_2	The scrolls revealed the second sacrifice, a hated foe, a prince of Ulthuan who had confounded the sorceress once before. |The assassin took his blood and she revelled in death. |The chalice begins to fill. |But more of Hekarti’s scrolls are needed to find the next sacrifice.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_hef_ritual_2	Finubar the Seafarer, the reigning Phoenix King, was called upon to reveal the second shard of the Star Crown. |The Way-fragments are cast so the tides move at the Seafarer’s command. |The living king has done his part, now it is time to evoke the royal spirits of old.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_def_ritual_5	With Felicion’s blood, the chalice is full and Malekith may drink. |The liquid inside no poison this time, but an elixir that will make his body ready to absorb the Vortex. |But first a god must be halted. |The accursed Skaven. They claim the Vortex, their devious schemes twisting it into a portal. |If the bell sounds thirteen, the Horned God steps unto the mortal realm. |Forces gather on the Isle of the Dead, where the greatest battle of our age will be fought.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_hef_ritual_5	The Star Crown reforged. |But the crown alone is not enough. |It must be borne into the Vortex, delivered to Caledor, by a hero worthy of Saphery. |And yet the chittering Skaven lurk. |Defiling Ulthuan. |Awaiting the Horned One’s arrival. |The Vortex must be reclaimed or the world is doomed.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_def_ritual_4	In the north reigned the fourth sacrifice. |One close to the cold heart of the sorceress. |A warrior, an enslaver, a warlord… |...a lover. |Not that her beauty was spared the assassin’s blade. |The prize of a murdered paramour is not to be given freely. |Only a brother could offer a sister such a gift.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_hef_ritual_4	Bel Shanaar, the explorer. |As he used the stars to navigate the world, their light shone upon the king’s lost vessel. |There Galifreius! I see it! |The fourth shard of the Star Crown was found within. |Thanks to the Phoenix Kings, the Star Crown is near complete. |But there is one who is yet to be evoked. |The first, the greatest… |… the doomed.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_race_intro_cst_aranessa	‘They’ say Wulfhart’s ship the ‘Vengeance’ is sunk. |Sixty cannons and two hundred souls… lost to the deep. |‘They say’ it was a fell storm that took her, or ‘some’ say it was pirates from the Maelstrom. |‘They’ say she was lost here… |…in the realm of Luthor Harkon, and to trespass in these waters is to invite death on board. |But then ‘They’ know nothing. |You waste our time.|Wait… This is the map you are looking for, crafted by Captain Jacob Wulfhart himself.

vo_fmv_texts_text_skv_win	The bell tolls for the thirteenth time. |And so, the Vortex is now yours. A gateway to many hells, and the throne of a god. |He Comes! Our clan at his side, I am at his side! |But the war is not over, the other races will fight on. |Bring ruin in the Horned Rat’s name or face his wrath!	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_lzd_ritual_1	The secrets upon the lost plaques were spoken and the skies above Lustria cracked with power. |Far below the heavens, under a forgotten temple. |The Ritual of Prognostication roused an ancient Relic Priest. |"Who stirs my eternal vigilance?" rumbled the Relic Priest. |As it revealed a dread prophecy. |If the Vortex of the Asur fails, Daemons unfettered will consume the world. Only the Great Warding can bolster the Vortex, but the comet's wake has left it fractured. |As the Relic Priest's eyes began to fade, it made mention of a lost key. The location of which would be revealed by four further rituals. |The rituals would realign the Great Warding, and the key, when found, shall unlock the power to permanently restore the Vortex. |The task was clear, find the sacred plaques and cast the rituals.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_lzd_ritual_3	The Great Warding is fed by the Geomantic Web, which in turn is sustained by the Slann residing in their Star Chambers. |And so the stars were sent closer to the heavens. |You must hasten along the road of enlightenment, or be overtaken by the warmbloods performing their own petty rituals.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_lzd_ritual_2	The cosmos engine was activated as the plaques foretold. |But it was not brute force alone that turned the gears. |Knowledge was the spark of ignition. |Ignorance is a chasm. Knowledge is the bridge that will deliver us from peril.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_lzd_ritual_5	The Great Warding is restored. |Energy flows unhindered through the Geomantic Web. |But the Vortex remains in peril. |The Horned God of the rat-spawn threatens to pierce the mortal veil. |Forces gather on the Isle of the Dead, where the greatest battle of our age will be fought.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_lzd_ritual_4	The lines of power were interrupted. |Whether by fate or design, the cure remained the same. |Clear the debris, and like the great rivers of Lustria, the energy would flow once more. |Progress has been made. |Yet the final tranche of hidden knowledge lays locked behind a door. |A key must be found.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_cst_win	The Krakenlord is defeated. |His mantle of the sea’s greatest pirate is almost yours, but there remains another task to fulfil. |The beast is lured to the surface. |Wulfhart’s harpoon yearns to be fired. |Now blessed with charms hidden within the ancient Sea Shanties, it thrums with power! |The Lore of Beasts to raise a beast.|Amanar has risen again, but its flesh rots, for it is no longer Ulthuan’s ancient guardian of the sea, but an Undead monster within your thrall. |You have the ultimate prize, a treasure greater than any jewel, and with it your infamy will spread far beyond the coasts. |The seas are yours, its prey and plunder await!	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_skv_ritual_1	The ritual enacted, the skies over the world shatter, exciting the Grey Seer, while his scribe cowered. For he knew their next destination. |Deep in the fetid jungle swamplands was the lair of the Screaming One. |Summoned to this plane by the ritual. |Not risking his whiskers, the master sent his minion into the lair. |Within the Verminlord awaited. |The Screaming One spoke of the Vortex at the heart of the Elf-things’ island-continent. |It was vulnerable due to the comet’s passing. Ripe for Skaven interference. |An Engine of Doom and Curses must be constructed and empowered by four more rituals. |The Vortex would be bound to this machine on completion of the final ritual, giving Skaven untold power. |The Screaming One granted the lowly scribe an object encased in iron. |The scribe eyed it greedily, but the Daemon demanded the gift handed to Grey Seer Vulscreek. |And a final gift, Rituals of Fabrication, to build the machine. |The Scribe’s adopted clan would begin construction at once. |But Warpstone is needed to power the rituals and Vulscreek already grows impatient.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_skv_ritual_3	The ritual revealed a new location. |It was in Lustrian swamps the Grey Seer sent his minions next. |Under the dank fetid surface, did they find Sotek-cursed bones to lash upon the machine. |The Council sends reports that other powers seek control of the Vortex. |The race is on.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_skv_ritual_2	And so construction began on a device to dominate the Vortex. |Warpstone-enhanced lumber was required. |And the gnawing of rats provided it. |The Grey Seer was pleased, and raced back to Skavenblight to report on his accomplishment.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_skv_ritual_5	The Skaven are on the brink of summoning forth their Horned God though the Vortex. |It is the powerful Grey Seer Clan than have been marked for the blood sacrifice. The souls the Great Horned Rat must consume to walk amongst us. |The Council of Thirteen, of which the Grey Seer Clan are most prominent, send their hordes against you, desperate to wrest the infernal machine from your clutches. |Other races sense their doom is coming, and all converge on the Isle of the Dead. |The greatest battle of our age is about to begin.	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_skv_ritual_4	Upon the Grey Seer’s orders did the scribe visit the laboratories of Clan Moulder. |To secure strong specimens, enhanced by the ritual, for the labours ahead. |Construction continues, but Skavenblight is strangely silent. |Are our Lords fully apprised of Vulscreek’s plan?	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_lzd_win	A Horned God banished. Rat-spawn cleansed from sacred shores. |The Vortex is secure. The matrices of the Great Warding enhanced. |But the Vortex has new, cold-blooded owners. This was always part of the plan. The Mage-Priests read it in the stars long ago. |Now the next stage can begin. |Commence the purge!	true
vo_fmv_texts_text_skv_horned_rat	Master Vulscreek, most unexpected. |Important time is this. The most holy of bells shall be skitter-leaped onto the device of Doom and Curses, yes-yes. |But I have studied device, not-not for controlling Vortex. |Ahhhh, finally you see the truth. A different purpose it has. |The fabric of reality was torn, and, from the Realm of Ruin, the Skaven’s Horned God visited its creatures. |"Clever child", it whispered, with the voice of a thousand screeching rats. |The celestial event that weakened the Vortex was of Skaven design. A parody of the true comet. |The Council of Thirteen were architects of this grand manipulation. They ordered the devious contraption built. |Its task complete, and fuel expended, the rocket fell back to the surface. |When the wreckage was discovered, its purpose remained unclear, until now. |It was the catalyst to weaken the Vortex and goad the other races into action. |Every ritual cast, the magic was stolen, absorbed into the Horned Rat’s Bell. |Now soaked in ritual power, the bell will be placed in its great carriage, made by the claws of the scribe’s clan, and moved to Ulthuan’s heart. |If it tolls thirteen times, the Horned God shall emerge from the Vortex. |But there is a cost. |The sacrifice of an entire clan. |The Horned God demands the chosen are made ready. |The Horned One has spoken, and your clan will be eat-fed to him. |You betray this clan. |No-no, this was Council’s desire all along. |See gift... a bell-clapper given to me. |And whichever clan has their blood spilt on it when the bell tolls, will be sacrificed. |Tell your lord, spill blood here. |No!
