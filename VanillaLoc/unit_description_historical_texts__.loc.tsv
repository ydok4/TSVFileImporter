unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_unit_long_text_skv_cha_tretch_craventail	Trench began his rise from anonymity when his Clawpack was leading a long line of Night Goblins back to Crookback Mountain. Ostensibly, the Clawleader had chosen Tretch to carry key items of the scavenged loot as a reward for his idea to spike the Goblins' fungus beer, but it is more likely he was chosen because he was deemed too scrawny to usurp the Clawpack. This proved untrue, as Tretch used a small keg of distilled Mad Cap mushrooms, the stuff that turns Goblins into deranged, spinning lunatics, to great effect. With impeccable timing, Tretch turned his line of slaves into whirling death-dealers just as the Clawleaders and Chieftains were convening to argue over which tunnel to take. The effect of multiple Fanatics chained to each other and attempting to twirl madly in a packed tunnel was spectacularly bloody. After that incident the Clawpack needed a new leader and Tretch was first to scurry into the gap. Since those days, he has led countless ambushes and proven himself a master survivor. It was Tretch that found the hidden path to attach the flank of the Dwarf gunline at the Battle of Black Crag; Tretch who led the raid that tunnelled beneath the camp of mighty Black Orc Warlord Dagbad and every single Goblin out from underneath the Scourge of the Dark Lands; Tretch was the only Skaven to escape the sinking of the Imperial Galleon captured on the River Aver. The detractors who jealously eye his rapid rise begin to get tail-twitchingly excited when they see Tretch's Clawpack flee the battle, wreathed in the fireball of a Weapon Team malfunction, or mauled by enemy formations. However, time after time, Tretch reappears, having left his doomed brethren and popped up elsewhere to accomplish some notable feat.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_necrofex_colossus	The unhallowed form of the Necrofex Colossus is one of the most terrifying anathema known to arcane lore. Varying in composition, they always hold true to the same basic form – a monstrous humanoid shape akin to a giant, fashioned upon a frame of galley-torn timber, iron, or bone, onto which the ‘flesh’ and musculature of the dead has been bound and shaped, with scores of corpses used in their creation. These gargantuan monstrosities fear neither pain nor injury, for they are walking vortexes of deathly energies around which the souls of the damned howl and against which few mortals can stand. With so much unholy power concentrated in their forms, a Necrofex Colossus is no mere mindless thrall, but possesses a deathly will and dark appetite of its own, often outlasting its creator or even proving their undoing should its master’s control slip even for a moment.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_skavenslave_slingers_0	The Under-Empire is run by slave labour. Skavenslaves perform all menial tasks, including mining, tunnelling, and food production. In lean times, they themselves become the food. The majority of slaves are Skaven born into bondage, the lowest class of a hierarchical society. Their ranks swell as rival clans are captured during internecine wars. At times even non-Skaven become slaves, although few other races last long under the whips of the ratmen overseers. In warfare Skavenslaves are used en masse to absorb missile fire and to overwhelm the foe with numbers. A common Warlord tactic is to whip Skavenslaves to the fore of an assault. Many are butchered, but the loss is acceptable if the slaves bear the brunt of incoming or tire the foe for the next attack wave. The best Skavenslaves will even pull down and tear to pieces a few of the adversaries, although this is considered a bonus.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cav_silver_helms_0	The Silver Helms are seen as the perfect exemplars of mounted martial grace and valour to which young Elves should aspire. Dragon Princes are too distant and aloof, Ellyrian Reavers perhaps a touch too wild and uncivilised; Silver Helms are proud without being haughty, and brave without being undisciplined. Thus, Ulthuan's legends more often centre around the deeds of its Silver Helms than any other warriors within the ten realms. Where the ranks of archers and spear regiments are drawn from the citizenry of Ulthuan, the Silver Helms are recruited purely from families of noble blood. Whilst such a calling is not compulsory, few amongst the nobility are prepared to invite dishonour by not fulfilling their duty. Furthermore, service as a Silver Helm is often considered the finest way for a noble to prove himself as warrior and leader both.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_emp_cav_empire_knights	The Knightly Orders of the Empire are organised along strict hierarchical lines, with every novice trained in martial values until ready to take up the mantle of a fully-fledged Knight. Of the many warrior orders throughout the Empire, the Knights of Sigmar’s Blood, Knights of the Broken Sword, Knights Griffon and the Knights of the Blazing Sun are but few from a long list of the worthy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_inf_skink_skirmishers_0	Skittish and quick, Skinks stand out from the rest of the sluggish Lizardmen. They are the mass workforce designed by the Old Ones to perform many different roles, and without them, Lizardmen society would quickly collapse. Skinks take up weapons during their many patrols as well as to join the fighting during times of war. As troops, they range between reckless audacity and sudden panic. Their skittish nature makes them much more prone to routing than the stoic Saurus. Most commonly, the Skinks advance before the bulk of the main army, harassing the foe's advance with hails of darts. When massed together in a fighting cohort, they can bulk out a Lizardmen battleline. The volleys of javelins and darts that the Skinks can unleash are astoundingly dangerous, for they have learned to coat their weapons with lethal toxins distilled from venomous amphibians, insects and serpents that thrive in the steamy jungle and profuse swamps of Lustria.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_black_coach	Legend has it that the driver of a Black Coach is a Wraith of some kind, and that grisly Nightmares pull it to war. On the battlefield, it feeds on magics wielded by sorcerers both mortal and ever-living. Driven on by the undying will of the Vampire couched within it, the Coach crushes or scythes down the ranks of the enemy without slowing. By creating a Black Coach, the Vampire's retainers can transport their master's rejuvenating form to places of slaughter. This allows the Vampire to revivify himself, drinking in the coalescing energies that swirl around the crucible of war. Each Black Coach is a magnet for such baleful forces; as it drives onward, it draws in the energies of the battlefield, shimmering with sorcerous power until it is all but unstoppable.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_inf_skeleton_warriors	The Skeleton Warriors of Nehekhara are ancient and eternally loyal troops whom have willingly followed their mighty rulers unto death, forming the very core of all of the Tomb Kings' untold armies. Rising up from the dusty dunes, rank upon rank of these Skeleton Warriors stand ready to kill once more in the name of their immortal monarchs. Holding curved swords and long spears, ancient forms awake from their deathly slumbers, forming up in vast regiments with a supernatural discipline that few living warriors can hope to match. The mighty armies of Nehekhara, made up of regiment after regiment of valiant soldiers, swore oaths of eternal loyalty before the gods to serve their monarch in life and beyond into death.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_inf_skeleton_spearmen	The Skeleton Spearmen of Nehekhara are not mindless automatons slaved to the will of an evil necromancer. The incantations of the Liche Priests summon the spirits of long-dead soldiers from the Realm of Souls and bind them into corporeal forms. However, without the extensive mummification lavished upon their lords and betters, the spirits of these warriors do not retain the full memory of their former existence. Upon awakening from their death-sleep, the only things that every one of these Undead soldiers can recall with perfect clarity is their unswerving loyalty to their king and the ways of war that were drilled into them in life. Thus, the skeletal regiments of Nehekhara obey every command of their Tomb King without hesitation - as they served him in life, so they serve him in death.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_celestial_wizard	The Comet of Power is the symbol of the Celestial Order, which is made up of Wizards who study the Lore of the Heavens that comes from the Wind of Azyr. Celestial Wizards, also known as astromancers, spend most of their time gazing into the night skies, plotting the movements of astral bodies. They are experts in divining the future and the most powerful of the order can even scry portents by peering into crystal balls. Celestial Wizards are equally feared and respected for the awesome powers that lie at their disposal; their spells are able to call lightning from the skies and summon meteorites to smite their enemies. The sixteen towers of the Celestial College are the tallest buildings in Altdorf. A shimmering dome of enchanted glass encloses the peak of each spire. The information gathered from these towers is fed into a vast, magical astrolabe at the heart of the college that spins on the head of a mystical silver needle. From this, the masters of the Celestial college read the myriad signs and portents in their bid to understand the Empire's potential futures.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_eternal_guard	Through the long Winter months, the forest of Athel Loren is at its lowest ebb, made dormant and vulnerable by the cycle of the seasons. The Treemen slumber, and even the normally vigorous Dryads are sluggish and slow. During this time, guardianship of the most sacred of places falls to the Eternal Guard, sons and daughters of Athel Loren's noble houses. Each Eternal Guard is a formidable foe in her own right, trained to a pinnacle of skill that other races cannot easily match. When assembled in numbers, they form a phalanx, their spears thrusting and cutting with a graceful yet disciplined efficiency. The Eternal Guard themselves refer to such a place as a "fortress of boughs". They face the enemy with feet planted firmly upon their chosen ground, shields braced against attacks and the line of spears rippling as their leaf-shaped blades dart forward to kill.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_sorcerer_fire	Those Champions of Chaos who seek mastery over the magical arts are known as Chaos Sorcerers, and they are madmen and malcontents all. Chaos Sorcerers wield the wild energies of entropy itself, reshaping reality to better serve their whims and those of their dark masters. A word and a gesture from a Chaos Sorcerer can strip a man's flesh from his bones, force a lover to murder his beloved, or cause a regiment of soldiers to burst into flame. They are amongst the most awful and depraved of all servants of Chaos, for they long ago sold their souls in exchange for the heady elixir of pure power. Where many of the world's Wizards, such as those taught by the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, glean their arcane skill from long years of painstaking research, a Chaos Sorcerer's understanding of the Winds of Magic is instant and innate. However, without the patience and wisdom that such study brings, a Chaos Sorcerer lacks due wariness and respect for the ultimate dangers of magic, and so begins an inexorable descent into deformity and madness. Many are the paths that lead to this ultimate fate, but most often, the Chaos Sorcerer seeks to expand his magical powers or harness more of the occult by simply bartering away another fraction of his soul, losing a little more of his humanity in the process. Before long, the aspirant feels his whole body and mind twist and alter, and as the gnawed remnants of his soul are finally devoured, he is plunged into the whirlpools of insanity, leaving behind nothing of the man who was.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_gutter_runner_slingers_1	Most suspicious deaths and acts of espionage in Skaven society are blamed on the nefarious Clan Eshin. Such accusations are probably true, but, of course, there is no evidence. Much of this devastation is wrought by the Gutter Runners, Clan Eshin's black-clad death squads. Gutter Runners have undergone training in the mysterious fighting style developed in the Far East. Because of their ability to bend and contort their pliable bodies with a speed and dexterity unachievable by man, Gutter Runners have no need for encumbering armour - they simply dodge the blows and missile of their foes. A unit is often led by a Death Runner - the term used for the most promising assassin-adept.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cav_ithilmar_chariot	The High Elves of Tiranoc are an adventurous people, proud of their fighting traditions, and deeply embittered by the wars that have ravaged their realm. When the Phoenix King calls his subjects to war, the fiery knights of Tiranoc are always among the first to answer, riding to battle at the head of a mighty chariot host. Spear-points and helms gleam in the light of the rising sun, and the ground trembles beneath thundering hooves. Banners of white, gold and blue stream in the wind. As one, the charioteers give voice to the battle hymn of Tiranoc, a rousing and beautiful anthem, sung at the mustering of the host since ancient times. In battle, the Tiranoc Charioteers fight with incredible skill, deft reactions complementing the speed of their straining Elven steeds. Only when the enemy is sufficiently weakened do the Tiranoc Charioteers crash into the press of melee in a glorious massed charge, the steeds biting and kicking, the riders thrusting their spears into the black hearts of their foes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_art_carronade	Many ships of the Undead fleets are equipped with broadside cannons known as Carronades or ‘smashers’, so named for the quick, splintering work they make of even the toughest ship hulls when brought within range. They first incapacitate their target before the zombie hordes board, murder, and loot according to their master’s will. As they sail off, another round of broadside cannon fire sends the ransacked ship and its blood-soaked decks to a watery grave. Carronades are comparable in size and power to the Great Cannons used in the field by the Empire, capable of causing a similar scale of devastation upon living targets and even reducing solid walls to rubble from afar. As with the armies of the Empire, Undead pirates drag their artillery onto the battlefield, with the hisses and cracks of smaller, handheld black powder weapons commonly preceded by the thundering booms of Carronade fire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_fay_enchantress	A figure of awe and inspiration, the Fay Enchantress is the personal representation of the Lady of the Lake, and as such is the most influential figure in all of Bretonnia. Her will is that of the goddess, and even kings of Bretonnia must bow to her wise counsel. The Grail Knights, having sworn their lives completely to the Lady, are bound by their sacred oaths to respond to any call or decree the Fay Enchantress makes. Their vows ensure that this duty is paramount, coming even before the loyalty to duke and king, for the Lady and the Enchantress represent the land of Bretonnia more so than any mortal Lord ever could. At times when the king has no clear heir, the Fay Enchantress alone has the power to instate a worthy replacement. Evidence of the Fay Enchantress' power over Bretonnian realms can most forcefully be seen during the time of King Ballaume the Brave, when she ordered the Grail Knights of the king's own court to forcefully expel him, stripping him of his title and honour before banishing him and installing his successor.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_dwf_inf_giant_slayers_0	Slayers are the strangest and most deadly of all Dwarfs. They are outlandish doom-seekers, individuals who have wholly dedicated the entire fibre of their being to the hardest and most destructive life of battle that they can find. They take the solemn and binding vow of the Slayer Cult, oaths which oblige them to forevermore seek death in battle at the hands of the most deadly enemy they can find. Next, Slayers shave their heads save for a solitary crest - a fearsome plume which they dye bright and stiffen so that it sticks out at alarming angles. Then they begin their quest for a glorious death, deliberately seeking out mighty targets to destroy such as Trolls, Ogres, or even Giants. In times of battle, Slayers arrive from the wilderness to join a throng, lending their considerable combat skills to the Dwarf cause. Many desperate wars have been won by the ferocity and sheer determination of the Slayers. Although they prefer to hew down towering monsters, at need, they will turn their axes to scything down any enemy. Even when bloodied and battered after a battle's end, they will pause only long enough to slake their thirst before beginning their deathquest anew.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_night_goblin_shaman	Night Goblin Shamans wear the easily-recognised hoods of their kind and are known for being particularly crazed due to eating vast quantities of hallucinogenic mushrooms. They are especially knowledgeable about fungus and only Night Goblin Shamans know the full rituals for growing, picking and preparing the deadly madcap mushrooms that can turn a Night Goblin into a ball-wielding Fanatic. It is said that a Night Goblin Shaman who eats too many mushrooms will eventually turn into a Shamanshroom, a magic-saturated fungal shoot. It is a damp, dull life as a mushroom, but it will probably get worse; as Shamanshrooms are highly coveted by other magic-casters, getting turned into one is surely a one-way ticket to being eaten alive.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_night_goblin_squig_hoppers	Once, in a reckless mood, a Squig Herder dared to leap upon the back of one of his catches. Driven to new heights of fury by the unexpected rider, the Cave Squig responded by bouncing with unflagging enthusiasm. The rider flailed about, screaming in a high-pitched manner while desperately holding on. This provided great entertainment and the remaining Herders cheered and cackled every time the Squig unseated its unwanted guest. Although the incident ended with both Squig and rider skewered atop a wickedly sharp stalagmite, it was an impressive enough spectacle to inspire the onlookers. Thus the tradition of riding atop Squigs was born and the first mob of Squig Hoppers soon followed. When the living balls of muscle, teeth and claws actually manage to bounce into the enemy, they deliver quite a blow. Squigs use their gaping maws and prodigious strength to gouge and tear, often biting victims in two. Their riders are far too preoccupied with clinging on to add their own meagre contributions. This doesn't stop some Night Goblins from bringing along clubs or weapons, but these are mere props brandished when bragging about their (mostly fictitious) heroic deeds.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_inf_syreens	In the dark, dingy taverns of filthy, pirate-infested places like Sartosa, tales are told of the ethereal horrors that haunt the most cursed corners of the oceans. The Vampire Coast is the most notorious of such places, and around its perilous shores and rocky outcrops where many a galleon has met its end, there lurk the ghostly Syreens. With howls that can turn even the bravest men stark white, spearing their souls like a lance through the heart and causing them to die of shock, they are like the Tomb Banshees of the Old World – tortured souls of evil Sorceresses who fear crossing the void to face whatever punishment awaits them for their malevolence. A single Syreen is a horrific thing to encounter, but it is not unheard of for the Necromantic Lords of the sea to bind them into terrifying groups to serve their nefarious purposes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_art_reaper_bolt_thrower	Reaper Bolt Throwers are used at sea to clear the decks of enemy vessels, and on land to scythe down ranks of enemy warriors. A mechanism of counterweights and cords allow the Reaper to shoot a hail of bolts, or a single missile with force enough to pierce a Dragon's hide. The bolts are barbed and difficult to remove from the wounds they inflict. Those injured - but not slain - by such a shot often suffer such horrendous maiming on the bolt's removal that they are worthless as slaves, and are therefore left to bleed to death or given over to the bloody caresses of the Witch Elves.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_boyz	Orcs, often known as Orc Boyz or just "da boyz", are the hard-fighting infantry found at the heart of most Greenskin tribes. Goblins are more prolific, but it is the Orcs that do the bulk of the bloody work in most battles. That is okay with all parties, as Orcs are a warrior race and there is nothing they like half as much as a good scrap. In fact, it is hard to get Orcs to stop fighting. They are an overly pugnacious lot and if no one else is around they will pummel each other just to keep their spirits up. Luckily, Orcs do not register pain as do other races. A typical green-skinned lout won't let a minor injury, such as a severed limb, keep him from fighting. Orcs are so tough and resilient that if the arm can be found and sewn back on (however crudely) it will heal quickly. Orcs naturally take their robust physique for granted and regard everyone else as weak, puny or "squishy".	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_saurus_scar_veteran_0	Saurus Scar-Veterans, also known simply as Saurus Leaders, are the most powerful of their savage kind. More than simply eight feet of savage reptilian muscle, Scar-Veterans are perfectly designed killing machines, their martial prowess further enhanced by battle experience. To their foes, be they ancient nemesis or simply those who trespass upon the sovereign territory of their masters, the Saurus leaders are nothing less than the vengeance of the Old Ones made manifest. All Saurus Warriors are spawned with the knowledge of how to fight, and the longer each lives, the more battles he survives. The longer he survives, the more he understands the needs not just of a lone warrior, but also of an entire army. While a Scar-Veteran cannot explain the meaning of a refused flank, he will know how to launch such a manoeuvre. A Saurus Scar-Veteran could not express why he chose a defence in depth to defeat a foe, yet he will inexorably recognise when such situations are called for and react accordingly. With only a low, grumbling growl and a final bellow, a Scar-Veteran can set an entire Lizardmen battleline in order. Once combat begins, Scar-Veterans hurl themselves into the fray with merciless efficiency. Each stroke, bite or thrust dispatches a foe, often with the enemy literally torn limb from limb by the ferocity of the attack.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_warpfire_thrower	Warpfire Throwers are one of the deadliest weapons within the arsenal of Clan Skryre, a weapon so powerful and dangerous that it is considered the hallmark of Clan Skryre ingenuity. The Warpfire Thrower is a crude yet highly volatile flamethrower that hurls a blast of concentrated Warpfire upon an enemy or a small area of ground. Warpfire Throwers are almost always grouped into teams of two Skaven; one carries a bulky and highly unstable fuel-tank filled with chemicals mixed with powdered Warpstone, while another aims the weapon at the enemy. With a single flick of a switch, a torrent of fuel will be unleashed that ignites into a greenish flame. Once the blast hits any solid object, the Warpstone imbued flame that the weapon spews forth sticks to almost any surface. Nearly nothing can douse the flames of a Warpfire thrower once it has engulfed its intended victim.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_ancestor_dramar_hammerfist	Like all Master Engineers, Dramar Hammerfist was a valuable member of his throng at Eight Peaks. Less of a warrior and more a master of fight-or-flight tactics, his preparedness for battle was such that he was always well-equipped enough to avoid face-to-face altercations. Instead, he would either take down his enemies from afar with his modified rifles or artillery pieces or, if all else failed, simply make a swift escape in one of his custom-built Gyrocopters. Known for his offensive engines of destruction, Hammerfist often left the design of defensive fortifications on home soil to lesser Engineers, considering it a bore. As the Time of Woes fell upon the Dwarfs, he was determined not to be entrenched in Eight Peaks, joining the first few forays against the invaders, led by Halkenhaf Stonebeard, and eventually going missing in action.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_ancestor_lunn_ironhammer	King Lunn Ironhammer was one of many Dwarf leaders who fought to protect the Karaks during the Time of Woes. Remembered as the last Dwarf king to hold sway over Eight Peaks before it was lost, he staunchly carried out his duties until the very end. With enemies closing in, King Lunn delayed his own throng’s retreat until he had successfully rune-sealed the Ancestor Tombs deep below the fortress, forever preventing any from entering, ensuring the continued sanctity of his Ancestors’ remains. Now, centuries later, Belegar has a powerful ally in his summoned forefathers’ ghost. With his help, Clan Angrund will surely succeed in honouring their vow to take back Eight Peaks once more - lest the shame of defeat will be carried down the Ironhammer bloodline forever!  	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_khazrak_one_eye	Possessing a ruthless cunning far above that of his bestial kin, Khazrak the One-Eye is the most dangerous and powerful Beastlord in the Drakwald. He has plagued the region for years, descending without warning and then slipping away into the shadows once more. Khazrak has a unique ability to control and harness the unruly spirit of the herd and devise simple but effective battle plans. He is unlike most Beastmen, his patient and cunning mind at odds with the normal headstrong nature of his kind. Khazrak's warband roams the Drakwald terrorising the townships and roads, and never before has a Beastman leader proven so elusive to retribution. No one is spared in Khazrak's attacks, his superbly trained Warhounds chasing down the few who manage to escape.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_heinrich_kemmler	Heinrich Kemmler burns with the need for power. Having recognised the limits that mortality placed upon him in his early years, Kemmler made it his life’s work to escape them. He plunged into the world of Necromancy as a young man, and by the time he had reached his fortieth year he was able to raise entire graveyards of corpses to do his bidding.

Kemmler became a great and much-feared Necromancer, plundering every Wizard’s tower and ancient temple he could find in his search for dark truths. His star was in the ascendant for many decades until ambitious rivals united to bring him to his knees. Although he finally managed to scatter his attackers with a great spell of confusion, Kemmler’s body was broken and his mind blasted in the battle.

For many years Heinrich wandered as little better than a half-sane beggar. By some quirk of fate, he uncovered the tomb of a long-dead Chaos Champion, whose burial mound was so magnificent it towered high above him. Here Kemmler struck a terrible pact with the Gods. They restored him to his former power and in return, Heinrich swore to slay and destroy in their name. Now, the name of the Lichemaster once again strikes terror into the hearts of ordinary folk.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_runelord	Runesmiths work spells in with their hammercraft, binding the Winds of Magic into mighty runes of power. They are a suspicious lot who jealously protect the secrets kept in their anvils and hammers, guarding the knowledge that allows them to make magic items - weapons, armour, rings and talismans - of greater potency than those wrought by any other mortal race. In times of great need, the most powerful Runelords bring an Anvil of Doom to battle - the most ancient heirlooms of the entire Dwarf race. They are the very anvils upon which the rune weapons of legend were forged, and were, perhaps, the very creations of the great Forgefather Grungni. They are specially made to attract and hold the Winds of Magic, arcane powers which can be captured and subsequently unleashed by a Runelord. Separate runes struck in the right order can call upon the different Ancestor Gods - Valaya for loyalty, Grungni to boost the power of arms and armour, and Grimnir to unlock the energies of fury.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_mon_moon_dragon	Dragons are amongst the oldest of all living creatures, even predating the rise of Chaos, and rode the thermals of ancient volcanoes long before warm-blooded creatures ruled the world. They are wise and aloof, viewing those around with a perspective only the eldest creatures can share. On Ulthuan, Dragons are the subjects of legends quite different to the terrifying folk tales of other lands. Without the Dragons of Ulthuan, the High Elves would have been annihilated thousands of years ago, for the Dragons are the Elves' oldest and greatest allies. Within Ulthuan, the realm of Caledor is the home of the Dragons, and in ancient days, those noble beasts seemed almost without number. However, times have changed. Now, in colossal caverns found deep within the Dragon Spine Mountains, the Dragons sleep away the centuries. A mysterious languor that began in the earliest years of Tethlis' reign has caused more and more Dragons to enter a slumber from which only ancient Caledorian songs can rouse them. Few young Dragons are hatched now on Ulthuan. The youngest are referred to as Sun Dragons, in reference to their hot tempers and the rich, warm hue of their scales. Those that surpass the Sun Dragons in might and enlightenment are known as Moon Dragons. The oldest and most powerful are referred to as Star Dragons, for they are truly as ancient as the very stars of the firmament. While any Dragon can savage an entire regiment of warriors, tear a Manticore apart or rip the head off of a Wyvern, a Star Dragon is so physically powerful that it can battle against even the Greater Daemons of Chaos and prevail.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc06_unit_long_text_chs_aspiring_champions	The frozen north spawns some of the hardiest warriors in all the world. Each is a paragon of deadly ability and lethal intent. Some ascend to command entire nations, some pursue the esoteric paths of the arcane, but the majority dedicate themselves to little more than the brutal butchery of all who stand in their way. These ruthless killers are known as Exalted Heroes. The history of many Exalted Heroes, recorded in scattered chronicles by the free people of the Old World, is a catalogue of woes and evil deeds. Their infamy shines bright as they capture the notice of the Dark Gods of Chaos with ever-greater feats of slaughter. They frequently seek out others of their kind to engage in ritual combat. When two Champions of Chaos clash, they duel to the death in the manner of gladiators, using the full force of every weapon at their disposal. When a victor emerges, bloodied but triumphant, he will cut a grisly trophy from his foe, claiming both his vanquished enemy's weapons and followers as his own. If the triumphant Champion has truly excelled, he may even succeed in attracting the attention of the Dark Gods and, in doing so, receive a more permanent reward for his deeds in the form of a mutation of daemonic gift. With each victory, the Champion grows ever closer to becoming a Chaos Lord, with whole armies to command and Daemonhood within his reach.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_gor_herd_dual_weapons	Gors form the great mass of the warherds. Their appearance varies, but all combine bestial features with those of a man. The base form of the Beastmen, and that possessed by the vast majority of the Gors, is the head and legs of a goat and the upper torso of a man, albeit a particularly hairy and malodorous one. They have the savage fangs of wolves with which to tear great chunks of flesh from their foes, and muscular and robust (if flea-ridden) bodies well suited to acting out their primal urges. To face a horde of Gors is to face anarchy and mayhem. Rowdy and undisciplined, they bray, bark, and bawl an unceasing cacophony that fills men's hearts with dread. Nonetheless, Gors are capable of taking to the battlefield in more or less ordered formations, a fact that many an enemy general has failed to understand until it is too late. Roving groups of Gors band into tight units that march beneath banners made from the flayed hides of their foes, while others tear the captured flags of defeated enemies, tattered and smeared with blood and dung. The Gors' raucous, bloodthirsty braying is accompanied by the atonal drones of crude pipes and horns in deliberate mockery of the Empire's proud regimental musicians.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_inf_skink_cohort_0	Skittish and quick, Skinks stand out from the rest of the sluggish Lizardmen. They are the mass workforce designed by the Old Ones to perform many different roles, and without them, Lizardmen society would quickly collapse. Skinks take up weapons during their many patrols as well as to join the fighting during times of war. As troops, they range between reckless audacity and sudden panic. Their skittish nature makes them much more prone to routing than the stoic Saurus. Most commonly, the Skinks advance before the bulk of the main army, harassing the foe's advance with hails of darts. When massed together in a fighting cohort, they can bulk out a Lizardmen battleline. The volleys of javelins and darts that the Skinks can unleash are astoundingly dangerous, for they have learned to coat their weapons with lethal toxins distilled from venomous amphibians, insects and serpents that thrive in the steamy jungle and profuse swamps of Lustria.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_cha_alarielle	Since the Golden Age, the Everqueen has served as Isha's chosen priestess in the mortal world. Whilst the tradition of the Phoenix King is relatively new, a mere six and a half thousand years in age, there has always been an Everqueen. Alarielle is the eleventh Everqueen to rule since the time of Aenarion. Her flowing hair is like a golden cloud, and it is said that so great and timeless is her beauty that it can move even the immortal gods to tears. The Everqueen's power is that of nature itself. Where Alarielle walks, the fields start to blossom and flowers spring forth from the ground. As a servant of light and nature, the Everqueen is opposed to corruption in all its forms. More importantly, her presence is anathema to tainted creatures of all kinds.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_bst_morghur	The vile, twisted creature known as Morghur is the essence of mutation and corruption given form. His coarse hair is woven through with gibbering, shrieking skulls, and his form flows and reshapes with every passing second. Morghur's lair is deep within a cave near the Forest of Arden. The dank, stone walls flow like water in his presence, constantly reforming to mirror the dark visions that plague him. Morghur's mind is filled with images of destruction and desolation. Hatred boils within his heart, and he is consumed with the desire to make his waking-dreams become reality -- to rip down civilisation in all its forms, to shatter order wherever it is found and to change the world constantly and randomly. As he walks the world, everything in his presence is irrevocably twisted. Grass grows in disturbing patterns beneath his hooves, streams flow backwards and animals mutate horribly.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_tomb_king	Tomb Kings are the ancient, long-dead rulers of Nehekhara. Their mummified corpses have been awakened by magical incantations, and their bodies are now inhabited by their undying, vengeful spirits. Reborn to a mocking imitation of life, transformed into hideous cadavers whose kingdoms have been plundered and lost, the Tomb Kings' rage fuels an unremitting need to conquer; they are the true monarchs of the dead, and they are coming to reclaim their rightful dominion. Revived by the rituals of the Liche Priests, a Tomb King awakens from the sleep of death possessing all the ambition and lust for power he had in life. Every Tomb King seeks to reclaim his plundered treasures and restore his ancient glory. If this means the subjugation and destruction of foreign lands, then his army, loyal even in death, rises from its rest at his command. Although it is the magic of the Liche Priests that animates the Tomb King's army, it is by the indomitable will of the Tomb King himself that they move and fight. Every Tomb King is an aggressive warlord, able to instil their warriors with their own unyielding vigour.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_mournguls	Travellers, hunters, and outcasts unlucky enough to get lost and endure slow starvation amongst the killing cold of mountain winters risk exposure to the most insidious effects of the Winds of Magic. Even the most steadfast men can turn into monstrous shells of themselves known as Mournguls – insatiable, razor-thin creatures of frostbite-cracked bone who dwell in the high, chill barrens feasting upon all who encounter them. Considered neither living nor dead, it is notoriously difficult to subjugate these ghastly spectres, but some who undergo the twisted transformation are forced into enslavement by those with the right necromantic knowledge. When the Winds surge and arcane storms scream across the world, powerful binding scrolls can be fashioned to exert control over the walking nightmares, making it possible to create small bands of lesser Mournguls to do one's bidding. Such creatures are less autonomous, but no less ravenous or able to kill.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_karl_franz	The Emperor is Karl Franz, Prince of Altdorf and Elector Count of Reikland. Karl Franz is said to be the greatest statesman the Old World has ever seen. He is also a military genius and a valiant general. The Emperor frequently takes personal command of his soldiers, wielding Ghal Maraz, the fabled hammer of Sigmar, like the Warrior God of old, smiting enemies of the Empire with every blow. Karl Franz often rides to battle on the back of Deathclaw, reputed to be the mightiest Imperial griffon that ever lived. A powerful bond exists between the beast and its master, one forged in countless battles and many adventures. During the Battle of Blood Keep, Deathclaw stood over the prone form of the wounded Emperor for three hours, slaying any who came near until the Reiksguard could hack a path to their fallen Lord.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_mon_ancient_stegadon	The eldest Stegadons are the strongest of their kind. Over the ages, some of their fiery temper has cooled and, as they often outlive their Skink crews, they gradually become more accepting of new handlers. Each new team honours their beast and elder Stegadons are widely venerated. Many crews will hammer bronze or gold plates covered with glyphs into their gnarled hide, more to mark a beast's status than to provide additional protection. Likewise, on the eldest of beasts, reinforced masks are set over the creature's headcrest, and ornamental bracelets or sharp metal tips are commonly seen to cover its horns. Ancient Stegadons frequently carry fearsome blowpipes in their fighting howdahs. Each fires a cluster of darts that separates in flight to create a hail of poisoned death. It is for good reason that the Skinks name these fearsome weapons 'Sotek's String'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_deepwood_scouts	Deepwood Scouts hold the responsibility of patrolling those areas of the forest deemed too dangerous for Glade Guard to enter. To tread such paths, an Elf must be invisible not only to a predator’s sight but to his other senses also – no easy matter when contending with otherworldly creatures to whom Elven souls manifest as brightly burning lights. The Deepwood Scouts’ skills of stealth and concealment serve them well upon the battlefield. They are masters of ambush and distraction, the assassins of enemy artillery crews and of careless Wizards who stray too far from the protection of their allies. Indeed, many an invading army has been brought to battle utterly unaware that kinbands of Deepwood Scouts have dogged its footsteps for days. Only when battle lines clash do the Deepwood Scouts reveal themselves, sowing confusion and disruption among the enemy force.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_sorcerer_lord_death	Those Champions of Chaos who seek mastery over the magical arts are known as Chaos Sorcerers, and they are madmen and malcontents all. Chaos Sorcerers wield the wild energies of entropy itself, reshaping reality to better serve their whims and those of their dark masters. A word and a gesture from a Chaos Sorcerer can strip a man's flesh from his bones, force a lover to murder his beloved, or cause a regiment of soldiers to burst into flame. They are amongst the most awful and depraved of all servants of Chaos, for they long ago sold their souls in exchange for the heady elixir of pure power. Where many of the world's Wizards, such as those taught by the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, glean their arcane skill from long years of painstaking research, a Chaos Sorcerer's understanding of the Winds of Magic is instant and innate. However, without the patience and wisdom that such study brings, a Chaos Sorcerer lacks due wariness and respect for the ultimate dangers of magic, and so begins an inexorable descent into deformity and madness. Many are the paths that lead to this ultimate fate, but most often, the Chaos Sorcerer seeks to expand his magical powers or harness more of the occult by simply bartering away another fraction of his soul, losing a little more of his humanity in the process. Before long, the aspirant feels his whole body and mind twist and alter, and as the gnawed remnants of his soul are finally devoured, he is plunged into the whirlpools of insanity, leaving behind nothing of the man who was.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauder_champions	In the eyes of the Northmen, there is a natural distinction between the mass of roving warriors, and the favoured few. The ultimate ambition of a Marauder is to die fighting under the gaze of the Dark Gods, or otherwise become worthy and powerful enough to travel to the far north to face their judgement directly. Individuals strong enough to walk that path emerge only occasionally: Marauder Champions, who fight and kill with more skill and ferocity than their brethren, and so gain a higher status in their warrior hierarchies. The otherworldly rewards are not always clear, however – these standout fighters epitomise both the glory and the risk of seeking the attention of the Dark Gods, treading along a knife’s edge between immortality and oblivion.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_grave_guard	Upon the walls of Drakenhof Castle, and the other Vampire-haunted keeps of Sylvania, patrol tireless warriors clad in rust-gnawed armour. These dread sentries are the Grave Guard - Wights drawn from their ancient tombs to act as guardians for the Vampire rulers of Sylvania. Although their bodies have decayed, leaving only bones and tattered flesh, Grave Guard are held together by evil magic so strong that it has endured for centuries. They wear ancient battle gear of primitive alloy, corroded by time and dusty with the years. These eerie, silent sentinels stand constant vigil on the crumbling battlements and at the iron-bound gates, never resting, eternally ready to defend their Vampire masters. When a Vampire marches forth, his Grave Guard advance at the head of the Undead host. They form a formidable corps of warriors, their enchanted blades cutting down the toughest of enemies with strike after pitiless strike.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_forest_goblin_spider_spears	The giant spider breed grows large enough to serve as mounts for Forest Goblins, who capture and hand-rear these scuttling nightmares. There are many sub-types of giant spider, such as Tilean Greybacks, Drakwald Mancatchers, and the Scarlet Deathheads of the Great Forest, to name just a few. All are poisonous and have steely, pincer-like mandibles that can punch through platemail to deliver a toxic bite. While not as fast as wolves or horses, these spiders can move at speed through the most dense patches of woods. Forest Goblin Spider Riders have become masters at stalking their prey, nimbly guiding their multi-legged beasts to scuttle across the treetop canopy to get into the ideal position before pouncing. Spider Rider mobs are known to ambush Empire patrols, eradicate Beastmen herds and even attack large monsters that encroach into their territory.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_giant	Chaos Giants are monstrous humanoids with a prodigious appetite for violence. They are single-minded engines of destruction, as dedicated to murder and mayhem as Champions of Chaos themselves. Chaos Giants are most often encountered in the far north of the world, being fond of the cold, rocky climes, and many find themselves in service to a warband, either for their fill of fresh meat and strong alcohol, or for the promise of slaughter and battle. A swearing, bellowing monstrosity that revels in displays of immense strength, a Chaos Giant is only content when it is crushing people beneath its enormous cloven hooves or smashing a battle line apart single-handedly. No wonder these creatures are favoured by the Chaos Gods, for they are annihilation incarnate. Chaos Giants are instinctively drawn to those who bear the favour of the Dark Gods, perhaps because the corpses are always thick on the ground in the company of such individuals. A Chaos Giant has the intelligence to recognise friend from foe, but little else, and it certainly has no real concept of obeying the orders of anything smaller than itself. Things such as tactics and strategy just confuse a Giant, who goes to battle primarily to kill and to feed. When a Chaos Giant has ploughed into the enemy ranks, it is as likely to grab a foe and store him somewhere for a later meal as it is to lay about itself with a jagged menhir or massive blade-studded tree trunk. Regardless of its whim, a Chaos Giant's attacks are always devastating.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_inf_zombie_gunnery_mob	Zombies are clumsy, drudge-like combatants, so more potent forms of magic are usually required to give them the dexterity required to operate firearms. Fortunately for seafaring Necromancers, all those who perish on the ocean are touched by the powerful magic of Galleon’s Graveyard – an oceanic realm of the Unliving that exists between the tangible and intangible worlds, sucking in the world’s shipwrecked vessels and the drowned corpses of their passengers and crews. The weapons of those reanimated from the depths may be rusted and sodden, but many zombies cling to the guns they held so dearly in life and use them with additional help from residual muscle memory. Wielding a shabby collection of black powder weapons long past their best, the Zombie Pirate Gunnery Mob appear to gain a small spark of the satisfaction they enjoyed in life through the random discharge of noisy, indiscriminate firepower.	true

To possess such a machine is a symbol of great prestige, and is ranked amongst the highest stations in battle, even though the Cold Ones' truculent nature can often bring the chariot to a jarring halt at the most inopportune moments. Should the crew retain mastery of their chariot, they thunder across the battlefield like gods of war, wicked spears levelled and Cold Ones roaring fit to freeze the blood. In the last moment before impact, the crew goad their steeds to one last effort and the chariot crashes into the enemy ranks, crushing foes with the weight of its impact and opening flesh to the bone with the blades upon its flanks.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_inf_temple_guards	The Temple Guard are a revered and uncommon spawning of Saurus. They were created to protect the Slann Mage-Priests and the temple-cities in which the Lizardmen dwell. To their tasks, they dedicate every fibre of their beings, displaying a single-minded determination that will result in either the safeguarding of their charges or their own deaths. As protectors, Temple Guard are matchless. They stand sentry, silent and motionless, not even blinking their eyes. It has been known for Temple Guard to maintain such a sleepless vigil for centuries, thick layers of dust settling upon their reptilian forms - yet the ever-watchful guardians are not immobile statues, and can erupt into sudden violence should they perceive any threat to their charges.	true

Gutter Runners have undergone training in the mysterious fighting style developed in the Far East. Because of their ability to bend and contort their pliable bodies with a speed and dexterity unachievable by man, Gutter Runners have no need for encumbering armour - they simply dodge the blows and missile of their foes.

Those foes who can muster the courage to stand before the sight of oncoming Cold One cavalry find themselves beset by a whirlwind of biting jaws, slashing talons and jabbing spear thrusts. Those Saurus Warriors blessed by Itzl have an innate aptitude for mounted warfare. They exude a musk not dissimilar to the rank odour produced by the Cold Ones themselves, allowing them to form bonds with the otherwise hostile creatures. The Saurus have dewclaws that are perfect for gripping the thick-scaled hides of their reptilian steed, leaving them free to carry both spears and shields.

This wonder weapon generates unearthly energy, which is directed along a rune-etched barrel forged and enchanted to channel such destructive fury. When fired, the Warp Lightning Cannon emits a sizzling ball of Warp-energy. Any near the shot are rocked in its wake, fur standing on end, with a sickly green light burnt into their mind's eye. The bolt arcs earthwards, punching through anything in its path and then erupts in a crackling cloud of pure Warp lightning. The shot flashes too quickly to follow, but its trail, once it lands on the ground, is easily marked - scorch signs follow its path and anything in the way will have a gaping hole in the exact shape of the beam.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_necrotect	Necrotects were the artisans of ancient Nehekhara - not common labourers, but architects of extraordinary skills whose ambitions far outpaced what could be achieved in a mortal lifespan. In death, Necrotects have lost none of their frenetic drive. They are filled with a compulsive need to pull down the inferior, vulgar cities of their enemies and supplant them with vast monuments of their own design. In life, Necrotects were stern taskmasters who oversaw tens of thousands of Nehekharans as they toiled under the blazing sun. Under their gaze, an army of masons carved huge slabs of rock out of cliff faces before vast columns of slaves dragged the stones across the desert and hauled them into position. All Necrotects were foul tempered, and they would dispense summary punishment at the slightest provocation, hating anything and anyone that threatened their art. In death, much of their work lies broken or damaged by the greed of tomb robbers and invading armies. Necrotects have been driven to a  blinding rage by the wanton desecration of their beloved masterpieces, and they have sworn to have revenge. In battle, Necrotects lead the Tomb King's regiments like the work gangs of old. They exude the same aura of hatred they possessed in life, and their mere presence instils a magical state of fury in the Undead warriors of Nehekhara.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_art_queen_bess	The infamous artillery piece known as Queen Bess is a monstrous cannon, so heavy and powerful that it requires constant maintenance due to the forces involved when firing it. Despite its cumbersomeness, its lethality makes it the pride and joy of any pirate fleet that manages to bring it into its possession, living or dead. The exact heritage of Queen Bess is uncertain, but it closely resembles a Hellhammer Cannon – a class of massive artillery originally designed by the mad alchemists of the Empire. Despite being utterly devastating, they were far too heavy to move on land – by mortals, at least – so ended up being used on Imperial Wargalleys. It is said that Luthor Harkon himself managed to steal one, refining and improving it in one of his more lucid moments to produce Queen Bess, one of the most powerful pieces of black powder artillery to ever grace a battlefield.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cav_horned_ones_blessed_0	The Horned Ones are an extremely rare, virtually extinct and preternaturally swift subspecies of Cold One, spawned in the same pool and at the same time as those who will ride them into battle. The Horned Ones are very aggressive and territorial, and will tackle virtually any other monster, regardless of its size. They are naturally adapted for fighting duels and have large horns and spiny crests growing out of their heads. Unlike other Cold Ones, Horned Ones are not easily manipulated to change their targets, as they are always enraged by the smell of other creatures invading their territory. A Horned One therefore behaves like a Cold One which has already tasted blood and is eager to fight. The bellowing of the Horned One infects other Cold Ones with the same aggression, steeling them against manipulation as well.	true

From a distance they may appear lithe and shapely, even darkly alluring, yet as they close their true nature becomes clear. A Harpy’s face is distorted and twisted, with nothing of humanity or intelligence in its eyes, only instinctive cruelty. Its lips are not those of a woman, but are twisted and leering, pulled back to reveal needle-like teeth dripping with blood and saliva. The creature’s limbs are not soft or shapely, but hard and possessed of tendons like steel, that lend it preternatural speed and agility.	true

On Ulthuan, Dragons are the subjects of legends quite different to the terrifying folk tales of other lands. Without the Dragons of Ulthuan, the High Elves would have been annihilated thousands of years ago, for the Dragons are the Elves' oldest and greatest allies. Within Ulthuan, the realm of Caledor is the home of the Dragons, and in ancient days, those noble beasts seemed almost without number. However, times have changed. Now, in colossal caverns found deep within the Dragon Spine Mountains, the Dragons sleep away the centuries. A mysterious languor that began in the earliest years of Tethlis' reign has caused more and more Dragons to enter a slumber from which only ancient Caledorian songs can rouse them. Few young Dragons are hatched now on Ulthuan. The youngest are referred to as Sun Dragons, in reference to their hot tempers and the rich, warm hue of their scales. Those that surpass the Sun Dragons in might and enlightenment are known as Moon Dragons. The oldest and most powerful are referred to as Star Dragons, for they are truly as ancient as the very stars of the firmament. While any Dragon can savage an entire regiment of warriors, tear a Manticore apart or rip the head off of a Wyvern, a Star Dragon is so physically powerful that it can battle against even the Greater Daemons of Chaos and prevail.	true

Driven by relentless obsession, these devout followers collect almost anything that a Grail Knight casts away, whether it be scraps of ruined armour, clothing, or even discarded food. Such is their burning passion, these religious scavengers will follow their idol through all weathers and lands, exulting in his acts and praising his sparing words. The Knights bear these followers with a dutiful resignation that borders on the stoic, though they endeavour not to encourage their self-appointed apostles. This is a vain hope, for even the merest word or gesture is seized upon as an act of great import and eagerly immortalised in tales and discordant song. If a Grail Knight is unfortunate enough to fall in battle, his devoted followers will swarm over this corpse, picking it clean of anything that could bear the Blessing of the Lady.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_royal_hippogryph_knights	Taming a hippogryph presents a challenge that many Bretonnian Lords cannot turn down, and this has made them into much sought after steeds. To successfully do so, the animal must be captured and broken at a very young age but, given the relentless territorialism of adult hippogryphs, acquiring a chick or an egg can prove a dangerous proposition indeed. Occasionally, the task of appropriating such a beast is given to a Knight Errant as a way of proving himself. More often, a duke will find suitable 'volunteers' from among the peasantry, promising a huge reward to any survivors that return with a healthy, young hippogryph.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_mon_carnosaur_blessed_0	Carnosaurs are large apex predators that have terrorised the darkness of the primordial jungles since the dawn of this world's existence. Considered by many as the ultimate jungle hunter, with some growing nearly two stories tall, these massive reptilian beasts are powerfully built and highly aggressive creatures, with long, muscular hind limbs and a heavy tail that is used to balance their enlarged and powerful skulls. Upon scenting prey, or catching sight of even the slightest amount of movement, Carnosaurs propel themselves with enormous strides, moving with surprising speed for such large beasts. Their shortened forelimbs and sharp claws are ideal for locking hold of prey. They have massive jaws, their gaping mouths filled with dagger-like death. Their bite can hack through huge chunks of flesh on larger prey, and by twisting their thick, serpentine necks, Carnosaurs can simply rip their quarries apart piece by bloody piece. Having tasted blood, a Carnosaur is at its most deadly, for it enters a state of savage bloodlust — biting and tearing at any living creature, sometimes slaughtering its gory way through entire herds of giant reptilian without pause. Such is what they were bred to become, for the primordial jungles of Lustria only spares the strongest and most ferocious of monsters, whilst the weak are simply left to be eaten by those seeking to consume flesh.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_norscan_giant	Giants are monstrous humanoids with a prodigious appetite for violence. They are single-minded engines of destruction most often encountered in the far north of the world, being fond of the cold, rocky climes. Many find themselves lumbering alongside the warring Northman tribes, either for their fill of fresh meat and strong alcohol, or simply for the promise of slaughter and battle. Many Giants of the north are instinctively drawn to the raiding men who seek to bear the favour of the Dark Gods – perhaps because the corpses are always thick on the ground in the company of such individuals. Smashing into enemy ranks to kill and feed, they have no real concept of obeying orders but, rather importantly, do have the intelligence to recognise friend from foe.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_skavenslaves_0	The Under-Empire is run by slave labour. Skavenslaves perform all menial tasks, including mining, tunnelling, and food production. In lean times, they themselves become the food. The majority of slaves are Skaven born into bondage, the lowest class of a hierarchical society. Their ranks swell as rival clans are captured during internecine wars. At times even non-Skaven become slaves, although few other races last long under the whips of the ratmen overseers. In warfare Skavenslaves are used en masse to absorb missile fire and to overwhelm the foe with numbers. A common Warlord tactic is to whip Skavenslaves to the fore of an assault. Many are butchered, but the loss is acceptable if the slaves bear the brunt of incoming or tire the foe for the next attack wave. The best Skavenslaves will even pull down and tear to pieces a few of the adversaries, although this is considered a bonus.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_cha_lord_skrolk	That Lord Skrolk walks the world is an affront to nature and a sign of the power of the Great Horned Rat. Plants wither and die where Skrolk treads and the very air about him seems to congeal and darken, as if stained by his baleful presence. Skrolk is ancient, having existed many spans of even the most long-lived of his foul kind. Rather than weakening with age, he is possessed of a diabolic vitality that belies the years and the heaped diseases he carries. Indeed, he is bent and gnarled under the weight of countless corruptions. The flesh that is not hidden by his tattered shroud is leathery and covered in a layer of dripping buboes. Even worse, the mysterious hunching growths framed by the robes promise something still more virulent. Each new pox only toughens the aged Plague Monk, who has himself become a walking disease.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_cha_handmaiden	Highest ranking of all the Sisters of Avelorn are the Handmaidens of the Everqueen. They are paragons of Elvenkind, as peerless in artistic pursuits as they are in the bloody business of battle. Should a Handmaiden grace the battlefield with her presence, she is treated with reverence by the High Elves that fight at her side. To serve as a Handmaiden is a great honour most commonly bestowed on those Sisters of Avelorn, who have proven their swiftness with blade, precision with bow and, above all, an unswerving loyalty to the Everqueen, many times over.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_def_cha_lokhir_fellheart	Some Dark Elves take to the seas in search of plunder or revenge, but many more do so to escape the dangers of Naggaroth. Not so Lokhir Fellheart, who was born to ply the rolling seas, bringing fire and terror to foreign shores. Putting to the sword any target he sets his attention to, Fellheart is the latest in a line of doom-bringing admirals to have commanded the formidable Black Ark known as 'Tower of the Blessed Dread', leaving countless ports and coastal cities ruined and ablaze in his wake. His deeds have not only earned him more glory than that of all his forbears combined, but also wealth beyond measure – slaves and treasure flow into Karond Kar as never before, earning him the grudging respect, if not quite the loyalty, of the city’s masters. The best plunder he keeps, but there is always plenty more for lavish rewards and bribes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_mon_ushabti	The Ushabti are large, guardian statues carved into the likeness of the gods and goddess of ancient Nehekhara, statues that stand guard and protect the perimeters of the necropolises and within the passageways of the great pyramids of the Tomb Kings. These Ushabti are imposing monuments to Nehekhara's former power, and all who pass through their shadows tremble under their unnerving and imposing sight. In times of need, the Liche Priests awaken the Ushabti with powerful incantations, and with the sound of cracking stone, the Ushabti step down from their plinths and daises, silent and ready for war. In ancient times, the living warriors of Nehekhara took great strength from the fact that the Ushabti fought alongside, for who could fail to be inspired by the physical representations of their gods marching into battle at their sides.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_skarsnik	Skarsnik is the chieftain of the Crooked Moon tribe and the most powerful Night Goblin in the World's Edge Mountains. All of the surrounding Greenskin tribes acknowledge Skarsnik's overlordship of the peaks, valleys and upper levels of the ruined Dwarfhold of Karak Eight Peaks. Through devious machinations and relentless spite, he has risen to command in the midst of the bitter and ongoing three-way battle between the Greenskins, Dwarfs and Skaven. A merciless opponent, Skarsnik is forever devising new traps with which to lure his enemies to their doom. His mere name kindles incandescent rage in Dwarfs; it is said that the abominable deeds of Skarsnik have gained their own chapter in the Book of Grudges, but the Dwarfs are not alone in hating Skarsnik. The Skaven have made innumerable pacts with the Greenskins, only to find themselves double-crossed by arguably the shrewdest Night Goblin ever. Skarsnik orders heaps of Skaven skulls stacked into grim monuments to demoralise his ratmen foes. Queek Headtaker, second in command and Right-Claw to the Grand Ruler of Clan Mors, has cowed to place the head of Skarsnik on his trophy rack. Not a day goes by in Karak Eight Peaks without some plot, probing raid, ambush, assassination or full-scale assault. Yet still Skarsnik rules supreme. By the light of flickering candles made of Dwarf-fat, Skarsnik sits on his iron throne and plots yet more wicked schemes of conquest.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cav_skeleton_horsemen	Regiments of Undead horsemen race across the sandy planes mounted on the fleshless remains of their once-proud steeds, weapons lowered as they gallop towards their foes. These skeletal riders drive their heavy spears into their foes with bone-jarring force, using well-aimed thrusts that punch clean through torsos and rip open throats in a spray of blood. Those not impaled by the cavalry rider's razor-sharp spearheads are trampled into the ground by the thundering hooves of skeletal steeds. When the Liche Priests summon the Tomb King's army from their sandy graves, fully formed cavalry columns stride out of the pyramids at the head of the legions. When the enemy is sighted, the cavalry regiment's hornblower signals the charge and a deep unsettling discord reverberates about the desert. This otherworldly sound shakes the dust from statues, and a disquieting feeling of dread permeates across the battlefield. As one, the Undead steeds gallop towards their quarry, the skeletal riders raising their shields and lowering their spears in perfect unison. It is a brave foe indeed that does not flee as these deathless horsemen bear down upon them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cav_skeleton_horsemen_archers	The horse archers of Nehekhara are likened to an angry desert wind, one that appears suddenly and leaves only the dead and the dying in its wake. Skeleton Horsemen Archers move relentlessly across the battlefield, firing volleys of magically blessed arrows into their foes before turning about and escaping retribution. As the Undead cavalry turn, they disappear from view, riding into the cloud of dust thrown up by the hooves of their skeletal steeds. Before the horse archers' stunned victims can recover their wits, the Undead horsemen reappear, loosing another deadly salvo. Skeleton Horsemen Archers are the outriders and scouts of the Tomb Kings' army. Whereas mortal horses need regular rest and water, skeletal steeds cross the vast tracts of open desert at a relentless pace. Even in death, the Undead horsemen maintain an innate ability to track and hunt their quarry through the shifting dunes, and no sandstorm can obscure their targets. As scouts, Skeleton Horsemen Archers hinder the movements of the enemy and harass their flanks in fleeting yet bloody skirmishes. These attacks do much to slow the advance of the Tomb Kings' enemies, pinning them in place while the Undead infantry are deployed.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_wulfrik	Wulfrik the Wanderer is one of the most devout worshippers of the Ruinous Powers to have ever journeyed across the world. With a hulking frame and tremendous skill at arms, his curse is to perpetually seek out the mightiest champions to duel – be they living, dead, mortal, or daemonic. His loyal warriors willingly sail to the corners of the world with him, raiding by his side as he takes the heads of all who dare cross his path. It is said that once Wulfrik has decided upon his next quarry, it is impossible to escape – such is his dutiful willingness to provide the murderous offerings due to the nefarious Dark Gods.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_cha_warlock_engineer	The notorious Warlock Engineers of Clan Skryre are the artificers of Skaven society, blending arcane sorceries with technology in an insane and mind-boggling mix. For the other races of the world it is hard to differentiate or define where the science stops and the power of magic begins, although such delineation never occurs to Skaven. Warlock Engineers see the two elements as one and the same - machines and sorcery blended together to create impressive killing power. The sorcerer-inventors often go to war carrying many of their latest devices. From hand-held weapons such as warlock muskets or poisoned wind globes of devastating potency, to blades powered by crackling Warpstone energies, the anarchic arsenal of the Warlock Engineers is both varied and destructive.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_inf_zombie_deckhands	Reanimated from corpses of drowned seaman and other unfortunates who perish at sea, Zombie Deckhands serve the eldritch admirals of the world’s oceans to make up the bulk of Undead pirate hordes. Festooned with rusty and corroded cutlasses and polearms, they are controlled with dread enchantments which enable them to be competent as crewmen as well as fighters, making them ideal for piracy. As with all warriors reanimated from the dead, however, they tend to be clumsy combatants, with their advantages mostly being in the fact they have no will of their own so will continue moving forward regardless of injury or futile odds. Nevertheless, the tempestuousness of the Winds of Magic that blow across world’s oceans means that despite their apparent mindlessness, some vicious spark of personality resides deep within the Deckhands’ rotten souls, making them all the more formidable in combat.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_forsaken	Forsaken are frothing maniacs that howl and scream as they sprint pell-mell towards the enemy lines, mutated limbs flailing and distended jaws snapping like those of ravenous beasts. Though they were once proud and mighty Chaos Warriors, because of the severe mutations bestowed upon them, they have become something less than human, with no more understanding of battlefield tactics than the hounds that gather around their bone-strewn lairs. Forsaken plunge headlong into battle without discipline or caution. They attack without heed for their own defence, a random mass of mutant appendages snapping in fury as they seek to tear their foes apart. These unfortunates have been reduced to the level of animals, and snarl and growl in a guttural parody of true language. Where they once killed in the name of martial ambition and the glory of the Dark Gods, they now kill because of a savage and unnatural hunger.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_ancient_treemen	Of all the Treemen of Athel Loren, there are those - old beyond mortal reckoning - whose names are revered above all others; these are the Treemen Ancients. When the first pact between forest and Elf was formed, it was they who spoke on behalf of Athel Loren, and they were old even then. Treeman Ancients seldom rouse themselves to war; they find the colours of the waking world less vibrant as they get older and so steadily retreat into the dreaming lands of sleep where their magics nurture and shape the forest's growth. Thus do the Treeman Ancients pass through the centuries in a state of dormancy, tended by a small group of Dryads. Only when dire times befall are they awoken from slumber, for only with their leadership can Athel Loren be roused to its full fury.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_treemen	The most powerful of Athel Loren's spirits are able to entwine their essence with that of a living tree, moulding it to their will. It is not a decision taken lightly, for when a spirit forms a bond with a living tree, they become irrevocably merged and cannot choose to leave - only death can sever the connection. From that moment on, the will of the spirit shapes and drives the tree, using knotted bark and  gnarled branches to serve where an insubstantial spirit form cannot. Thus is a Treeman born. Certain to be counted amongst the mightiest of Athel Loren's denizens, his gnarled form is almost impervious to harm, and his strength a near-match for the Dragons of the deep glades. Treemen do not fight with grace or finesse, but with huge sweeping blows that strike home with enough force to shatter stone. They can stomp their knurled feet into the ground, knocking foes down, or even send writhing roots to drag foes deep underground where their tendrils can feast upon the flesh and bone.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_spawn	A warrior who is visited by too many gifts of the Dark Gods eventually succumbs to madness and mutation. His altered body reaches a point where reason no longer sustains it, and he wails in anguish as his flesh ripples, sprouts and writhes, undergoing the most profound and final of changes. Truly, Chaos Spawn have a thousand faces and forms.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_cha_assassin	Skaven Assassins are the pinnacle of Clan Eshin warriors, elite killers in a class of their own. The few who know of the existence of the black-clad Assassins fear them above all others. Rumours of their cut-throat abilities are whispered in fear: the Clan Eshin devils are invisible and their very shadows are poisonous. The art of sabotage, arson, and poison all form part of an Assassin's deadly bag of tricks. Many Assassins-in-training are lost as the regimen is gruelling. The final tests are death missions assigned by Clan Eshin's ruling council, presided over by Lord Sneek, the leader of the clan and one of the Lords of Decay. After surviving such actions, an Assassin is considered an acknowledged master in the methodology of murder.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_boar_chariot	By lashing together rough-hewn logs, Orcs are able to construct formidable chariots. It takes two powerful war boars to pull such a blocky construction and, at first, even these thick-muscled beasts struggle. With some grunting and not just a little straining flatulence, the boars finally get the crude wheels turning. Once the churning porcine legs have the chariot rumbling along at full tilt, it becomes an impressive shock weapon, capable of slamming into the enemy with the force of a thunderbolt, albeit a hairy and stinky one. If the sheer impact of such hurtling force does not smash the foe, there are always the iron-shod wheels with crude blades attached, the goring tusks of the boars or the spear thrusts of the Orc crew themselves. While not as fast as a wolf-drawn Goblin Chariot, the heavier Orc vehicle hits harder and in return can absorb considerably more punishment than the flimsier gobbo-crewed devices.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_ancestor_throni_ironbrow	Karak Azul is a prosperous Dwarfen city to the south of Eight Peaks, renowned for producing powerful weapons of unrivalled quality. In the ancient times it was a process overseen by the Master Runesmith Throni Ironbrow, a distant blood-relative and close friend of King Lunn Ironhammer of Eight Peaks. When Ironbrow received word that Eight Peaks would likely be the next stronghold to fall, he demanded permission to leave his throng to make the treacherous Underway journey northwards to help his kinsperson. Such was his value to Karak Azul that his request was immediately denied – perhaps it was little surprise that Eight Peaks would eventually fall, leaving Karak Azul the only Southern Dwarfhold to withstand the Greenskin armies that surged into Dwarf territory during the Time of Woes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_inf_shadow_warriors	The Shadow Warriors are masters of ambush and guerrilla warfare, and are elite warriors even among other Elves. They strike swiftly and noiselessly from concealment with deadly accurate volleys from their longbows, before charging forth to slay any survivors with a flurry of blades. Even at times when the populace of Ulthuan does not consider itself at war, there is no respite for the Shadow Warriors. Weary and grim, they constantly patrol the barren shores and bleakest hills of Nagarythe. They keep a constant vigil against approach of the evil Druchii who sank their homeland beneath the waves.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_art_plagueclaw_catapult	It was in the Southlands that crude torsion devices first began hurling loathsome substances onto the foe during battle. The Plague Monks learned to deliver their pestilent payloads via catapult, the erupting splatter of deadly contents slaying targets in a toxic storm. Those splashed by the semi-congealed liquid find their skin simultaneously sloughing off in ruin and elsewhere erupting in glistening spores.  Armour offers no protection against such a loathsome weaponry. Plagueclaw Catapults are great, wheeled scaffold-towers bearing catapults. Pushed into position by ragged Clan Pestilens acolytes, the claw-like arm of a Plagueclaw Catapult is winched back and unleashed to lob hideous death. The toxic semi-liquid leave a glowing streak across the sky as it arcs earthward.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_sorcerer_lord_metal	Those Champions of Chaos who seek mastery over the magical arts are known as Chaos Sorcerers, and they are madmen and malcontents all. Chaos Sorcerers wield the wild energies of entropy itself, reshaping reality to better serve their whims and those of their dark masters. A word and a gesture from a Chaos Sorcerer can strip a man's flesh from his bones, force a lover to murder his beloved, or cause a regiment of soldiers to burst into flame. They are amongst the most awful and depraved of all servants of Chaos, for they long ago sold their souls in exchange for the heady elixir of pure power. Where many of the world's Wizards, such as those taught by the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, glean their arcane skill from long years of painstaking research, a Chaos Sorcerer's understanding of the Winds of Magic is instant and innate. However, without the patience and wisdom that such study brings, a Chaos Sorcerer lacks due wariness and respect for the ultimate dangers of magic, and so begins an inexorable descent into deformity and madness. Many are the paths that lead to this ultimate fate, but most often, the Chaos Sorcerer seeks to expand his magical powers or harness more of the occult by simply bartering away another fraction of his soul, losing a little more of his humanity in the process. Before long, the aspirant feels his whole body and mind twist and alter, and as the gnawed remnants of his soul are finally devoured, he is plunged into the whirlpools of insanity, leaving behind nothing of the man who was.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_inf_temple_guards_blessed	The Temple Guard are a revered and uncommon spawning of Saurus. They were created to protect the Slann Mage-Priests and the temple-cities in which the Lizardmen dwell. To their tasks, they dedicate every fibre of their beings, displaying a single-minded determination that will result in either the safeguarding of their charges or their own deaths. As protectors, Temple Guard are matchless. They stand sentry, silent and motionless, not even blinking their eyes. It has been known for Temple Guard to maintain such a sleepless vigil for centuries, thick layers of dust settling upon their reptilian forms - yet the ever-watchful guardians are not immobile statues, and can erupt into sudden violence should they perceive any threat to their charges.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_khalida	Khalida Neferher, the Warrior-Queen of Lybaras, was highly respected across all the lands of Nehekhara. Her intelligence and bravery were as legendary as her intense sense of honour and justice. Her reign was tragically short, as she was cut down in her prime, and all of Nehekhara mourned her passing. Khalida was embalmed and placed in a seated position within a specially made reliquary. There she sits unmoving, her face concealed behind a beautiful death mask created in her likeness. In times of need Khalida awakens, and the power of Asaph infuses her mummified remains. Her flesh returns to its former beauty, gradually becoming as pale and hard as pristine white marble. Gracefully, she rises from her throne and glides across the temple floor, commanding the tall heavy doors to open with a delicate motion of her hand. Her famed archer legions, buried in vast tomb pits beside the temple, arise at her bidding, marching alongside their immortal warrior-queen as they did in life, bringing death to those that intrude upon her realm.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_marauder_chieftain	The tribes of Northmen that flock southwards with any Chaos invasion are known by those in their path as Chaos Marauders. These savage barbarians fight with heavy axes and cruelly barbed flails, and charge in great howling mobs towards the foe. They have little fear of dying in battle, for they know that they fight under the scrutiny of their gods, and that cowards are beneath their deities' notice. The Chieftains that lead these warriors are a daunting sight, brooding hulks of muscle and hair whose bodies are covered in the scars and trophies of battle. Bearing weapons worn from dealing a thousand mortal injuries to those foolish enough to face them, these savage leaders are independent and fierce. These battle-hardened killers are the products of a people so steeped in conflict that, even in times of prosperity, they will fight to the death for the honour of leading the next raid.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_cha_hand_of_the_shadow_crown	The Shadow Warriors, Alith Anar’s masters of irregular warfare, are the elite warriors of the Elven race. From among their number, the Shadow King raises up the greatest warrior with the greatest grasp of strategy and tactics to be his ‘hand’, who advises him and carries out his will with a furious precision. On those occasions where Alith Anar’s force must split into two, the Hand of the Shadow Crown leads the second contingent, bringing death to the Dark Elves with the same ruthless efficiency as his unswerving liege.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_treekin	At the heart of every Tree Kin resides the soul of a dead Elf, though this is not the fate of all. Only the strongest and most driven souls retain enough individuality to become such creatures. Most, eager to renounce the identity and struggles that shaped their mortal lives, pass into the Weave of the forest. Though their family and friends might occasionally fancy that they can hear their loved one's voice upon the wind, it is but an echo of a life long abandoned. However, those souls that become Tree Kin are unable to completely abandon their grip on their former lives, and they forge themselves a new body out of dead timber so that they might continue to defend in death that which they loved in life.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_amethyst_wizard	Amethyst Wizards have mastery over spirits, and it is said that they can steal the souls of the living and summon black winds of death. Whilst such abilities are as nothing compared to the evil sorceries of true necromancy, their morbid association forever taints Amethyst Wizards in the eyes of the common folk. They are particularly loathed by Priests of Morr, who are deeply suspicious of the Amethyst Wizards’ penchant for lurking near their cemeteries. Indeed, the halls of the Amethyst College are akin to a great necropolis, and the stench of death lingers around it.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauder_warwolves_chariot	The Marauder Warwolves Chariot is an interesting take on the standard war chariots commonly used by the Northmen and other warriors of Chaos. The same spike-laden chassis gives it a similarly devastating impact on the charge, but instead of being pulled by destriers, it is pulled by brutish Warwolves. This gives the chariot several advantages – firstly, the swift, muscle-built beasts enable the chariot to move faster over short distances. Also, unlike horses, Warwolves are natural killers in their own right – bloodthirsty animals concerned only with biting and tearing at enemy flesh. This makes the Warwolves Chariot a truly scary prospect up close; snapping, slobbering jaws await any who engage the charioteers in melee.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_shaman_sorcerer	The Shaman-Sorcerer is, more often than not, a practiced murderer. He pursues dark pacts and bargains with numerous petty Chaos godlings and daemons as the source of his arcane powers, and uses his prophetic influence to guide the tribes towards war. Shaman Sorcerers are rightly feared due to their prophetic seer-craft and unholy mastery of the stormy Winds of the frozen north, conducting Daemonic rituals as a way of gaining favour from the Dark Gods. That is not to say they are incapable of face-to-face combat – they take to the battlefield with both staff and axe, wielding magic as well as cutting down any unfortunate foe who happens to get too close.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_skink_priest_0_summoned	On occasion, a Skink spawning will not produce an entire cohort from the pools of life, as is the norm, but instead only a single Skink will issue forth. These individuals are marked by the Old Ones and destined to lead, or otherwise achieve greatness amongst their kind. Those Skinks attuned to the energies of the world and that show an aptitude for magic are the Skink Priests, the most intelligent of their kind. Their role is to become the personal attendants of the mighty Slann Mage-Priests, and act as the prophets of the Lizardmen, as the only ones capable of interpreting and executing the will of their Slann masters. This is rarely straightforward, as entranced Slann do little more than mumble, yet each utterance, even the most incoherent whisper, might have vast consequences - for of all living creatures, the Slann are the most powerful of mages, and they alone worked under orders from the Old Ones. As it is strictly forbidden to disturb an entranced Slann in any but the direst of times, it is left to a Skink Priest to make many daily decisions for the whole of Lizardmen society. On behalf of their masters, it is their role to ensure that the Great Plan comes to fruition.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_mon_carrion	Carrion are terrifying Undead birds of prey that resemble giant, reanimated Vultures which feast upon the carcasses of those that have fallen within the lands of Nehekhara. Their broad wings, covered in feathers as black as midnight, darken the sky and spread the shadow of doom upon those dying in the desert. These Undead birds can smell blood from leagues away, and they are drawn to battlefields like moths to flame. Wherever Carrion are seen to fly, death and carnage are surely nearby. According to inscriptions, they were sacred beasts, agents of Ualatp, the vulture-headed God of Scavengers, who bore the spirits of lost warriors to the sky to fight in endless battles against the Daemons of darkness. This belief led to the Mortuary Cult burying corpses of Carrion in the necropolises, entombing many thousands within the pyramids of the Tomb Kings from the time of Nekhef I, who claimed to be the first ruler to use Carrion in his army of eternity and onwards. From these ancient corpses, the Carrion fly across the skies of Nehekhara to feast once more.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_cha_alith_anar	Tradition maintains that the folk of Nagarythe chose Alith Anar as ruler after Malekith fled into the west. The Lord was the last heir of a great line, his forebears slain by the Witch King’s minions. In the following dark days there were many Druchii still hiding in Ulthuan, so Anar took to their eradication. Those not slain in battle were crucified upon trees - grisly monuments to the vengeance of Nagarythe’s Shadow King. He became a revenant who sought the death of every traitor-kin who dared live in the Sundering’s wake. Even now, thousands of years later, the Shadow King still hunts, and will not rest his bow until Malekith’s death.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauder_warwolves	As with all creatures of the Old World, the further north one goes, the more likely an encounter with a beast touched by the mutations of the Ruinous Powers. Marauder Warwolves are one such afflicted beast – like their Warhound cousins, the Warwolf mutation is the result of exposure to the energies of Chaos deep in the malign wilderness of Troll Country where they originate, enabling them to freeze foes in their stride with only their icy breath. Woe betide any unfortunate soul who strays into the Warwolves' territory, who will likely hear their mournful howls before being hunted, frozen, and devoured.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_varghulf	A Varghulf has a monstrous body, swollen by a constant diet of red meat. Unbound by human form, a Varghulf is a contorted mass of packed muscle, giving it the strength to crush a chariot or bowl over entire ranks of those stupid enough to try and pen it in. Powerful legs and broad wing-flaps allow Varghulfs to chase down their kills in swift, gliding leaps, and they can lash out at enemies around them with shocking speed. They use their immense claws to strip flesh from bone, the better to suck at the juicy marrow of their prey. A Varghulf's main weapon, however, is a wide mouth filled with dagger-like fangs capable of puncturing armour and crushing skulls. In battle, the Varghulf becomes a whirlwind of rage. Though voracious and unpredictable killers, Varghulfs are far from mindless. They do not possess the aptitude or inclination for sorcery of their Vampiric cousins, but their presence still acts as a conduit for Dark Magic, and they are able to reknit themselves with the raw stuff of Necromancy should they suffer injury.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_damned	Many decades ago, Cylostra was the favourite court singer of Bretonnian royalty, a renowned performer for kings, rich nobles, and eminent stately guests. Her sense of self-importance could not be understated – whenever she travelled across the lands of chivalry to give her performances, she did so with a huge entourage made up of servants and attendants who would cater to her every whim. Part of this accompanying group were the unfortunate Knights and Paladins assigned to protect her on her travels, a job typically given as punishment for a misdeed or any unchivalrous behaviour that was not quite worthy of execution. Now long-dead, in life these formidable horsemen could not save Cylostra from her ultimate fate of drowning in the sinking Lamprey all those years ago, but her vengeful soul sometimes calls upon their spirits to return from the afterlife to serve her in the tangible world once more.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_spearmen_at_arms	Each Midsummer, commoners flock to their Lord's castle to present their sons in the hope that they will be trained as Men-at-Arms. For a peasant to have a son accepted into the ranks of a Knight's household is a great honour. Some young peasants will have been guided towards this goal through their entire life, encouraged to stand up straighter and taller than the usual peasant 'slouch' to better improve their chances of selection. All morning and afternoon the Knight inspects the candidates. By dusk, the luckiest and strongest are selected and are taken back to the castle where they are given basic training and outfitted in the livery of their Lord.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_slann_mage_priest_high_0	The favoured servants of the Old Ones, the Slann have considerable intellect and magical abilities, and rule the Lizardmen as venerated Mage-Priests. Although not physically menacing - their bodies are toad-like with large heads and bulbous eyes - with a flick of their multi-jointed fingers, Slann can topple cities, engulf foes in flames or open vast rents in the ground below. Enemy Wizards find even the mightiest incantation they try to employ unravelling before them as the Slann contemptuously waves its hand. The Slann see the world differently from other beings. Their orderly minds are constantly at work - deciphering complex problems and wandering the cosmos. They sit unmoving on their stone palanquins or in their Star Chambers, and to an outsider a Slann might appear asleep, or even dead. So deeply do they meditate that signs of life are hard to detect - their breaths are shallow and far apart, their eyes unblinking and vacant. Yet the Slann are attuned to more than mortals realise - for they can perceive the magic and raw disorder that has hung in the very air since the great influx of Chaos.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_khatep	Khatep, known as the Liche Lord, is the current Grand Hierophant of Khemri, and the religious head of the Mortuary Cult's hieratic council. Khatep is the oldest and wisest of all the Liche Priest and the first member of their order to truly deny death's embrace, if not the ravages of time. He is ancient beyond memory, cadaverous and hunched over as if he carries the weight of epochs upon his shoulders. Following the casting of Nagash's Great Ritual, civil war threatened to destroy Nehekhara. Khatep therefore took it upon himself to restore order. He broke the magical seals of the Great Pyramid of Khemri and awoke the greatest of the Tomb Kings: Settra. At the end of the mighty incantation Settra arose and smote any who opposed him. Before long all bowed their heads to Settra, and though he sat once more upon the throne of Khemri, his wrath was great. Settra was angry foremost with the Mortuary Cult, believing they had whispered lies about the extent of their powers. In his fury, he exiled Khatep from Khemri and forbade him to set foot within any of the great cities until such a time as he could fulfil the Mortuary Cult's ancient promise and reinstate the golden age of Nehekhara. Thus, Khatep wanders the deserts in search of scrolls, inscriptions and relics of power that he believes will restore his beloved kingdom to its former glory.	true

They are powerful sorcerers, capable of channelling eldritch energies in destructive ways, levelling enemy armies with lightning, or summoning ravening swarms of rats. Some Grey Seers ride atop the nightmarish Screaming Bell to unleash untold ruination. More important than their ability to dominate a battle, however, is their role as emissaries for the Council of Thirteen, a position which often grants them the top-rank. Having the backing of a Grey Seer means a clan is in ascendancy, and will gain supremacy in dealings with others. They may barter with the upper hand and a Skaven with an advantage will press it mercilessly. It is always best to exploit such an advantage while it lasts, for it will only be a matter of time before the Seers call with their own demands. In Skaven society it is well known that absolutely nothing comes without a steep reciprocal price.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_glade_lord	The lords and ladies of Athel Loren have ruled the Wood Elves for millennia. Each highborn is required to keep his domain free from intruders and has the ultimate responsibility over the area of the forest in which his followers dwell. Most often, this is a task that is accomplished by the Highborn's Eternal Guard and Glade Guard, though in more dangerous times, he or she will entreat the spirits of the forest, or even Elves from other regions of Athel Loren, to lend their aid. Though the inhabitants of Athel Loren are as proud as any of the Elven races, they never allow their own hubris to endanger their homeland. The defence of Athel Loren is the one calling that is held above all others. When Athel Loren goes to war, the nobles direct the efforts of its armies, often commanding a varied yet lethal assortment of Elves and forest spirits. In the summer months, when the forest is strong enough to defend itself against most threats, many are caught up in Orion's great hunt. Even so, there are always a handful of able war-leaders who remain within the borders of the wood, ready to defend their home to their dying breath.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_vmp_strigoi_ghoul_king	The pallid creatures known as Ghoul Kings are in fact once-proud Strigoi Vampires forced into a troglodytic existence. Though all Strigoi descend from the same ancient lineage of Ushoran, they have devolved to become something far fouler and more hate-filled than their brethren. The Ghoul Kings spend their days creeping through the hidden places of the world, but under cover of night, they will wreak their vengeance at the head of a shambling army of Undead. At times, powerful Strigoi Ghoul Kings raise vast armies around themselves and push south in a desperate attempt to recreate the kingdom they lost. So far, their advance has always been halted by the warmongering tribes of Greenskins blocking the way to the Badlands, or by disciplined armies of the Tomb Kings that stride out from the desert. Yet across the Old World, the minions of the Ghoul Kings have been sighted ever more frequently. Some say the ancient brethren of the Strigoi are uniting under one leader and massing great armies of degenerate beasts in their cavernous lairs. If this is true, no creature - living or dead - is truly safe from their wrath.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cha_teclis_1	Among the High Elves the names of Tyrion and Teclis are spoken with hushed respect. The fame of those twin brothers extends throughout Ulthuan and into the lands beyond. Born into one of the oldest families of Ulthuan, the brothers can trace their line back to the doomed Aenarion, first and mightiest of the Phoenix Kings of Ulthuan. It is their destiny to perform mighty deeds and shape the fate of kingdoms. Teclis is Tyrion's twin brother, but two more different siblings would be hard to find. Where the curse of Aenarion has yet to leave an obvious mark upon Tyrion, it has made his brother frail and caustic. Indeed, so feeble is Teclis that his body can only be sustained by the consumption of magical potions. Yet no-one, least of all Tyrion, sees Teclis as the weaker twin - his destiny merely lies along another path. Teclis has been blessed with a talent for magic that makes him preeminent, not only amongst the mages of Ulthuan, but in the whole world. Though it is little acknowledged in Naggaroth, the Witch King accedes that Teclis is his superior and, since the Battle of Finuval Plain, has taken care not to come into direct conflict with his younger cousin. It is even claimed that Teclis' power approaches that of the great Necromancer Nagash, so it is fortunate that he has devoted his life to thwarting the powers of Chaos and death. 	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_master_necromancer	As a man follows the dark path of the Necromancer, he becomes ever more detached from his mortal roots. Morbidly questing after the secrets of death, a Necromancer deeply steeped in the lore of the dead stands on the threshold between worlds, neither wholly alive, nor one of the Undead. His body twisted with unholy power, his mind seared by the horrors he has witnessed, a Necromancer often has more in common with his lurching, moaning minions than with the living he seeks to slay.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_foot_squires	Serving their Knightly masters in both times of peace and war, Squires are effectively errand boys for their Lord, fulfilling menial or unsavoury tasks that their masters would prefer to delegate. Yet in battle, they fight with every ounce of skill and ferocity that their training has given them, using their two-handed blades to cleave through all foes in the name of the Lady, Bretonnia, and their Lord’s glory. For a Squire, every battle is a chance to perform some great deed or service to his master; it is his only chance – albeit a miniscule one – to be elevated to Knighthood.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_centigors_great_weapons	Centigors are a disturbing cross between four-legged creatures, such as horses and oxen, and the bipedal beasts of Chaos, merged together by the Ruinous Powers in ages past. They possess the hindquarters and forelegs of their quadruped ancestors, granting them great speed and strength, but the upper body of a humanoid, with which they wield brutal weapons. Strong, vital and crude, these beast-centaurs are powerful creatures. However, they are not especially agile, and while they have great strength they lack the dexterity to manipulate objects with any skill or control. Centigors are bitter and spiteful, resenting their clumsy, awkward nature, and harbour a deep jealousy of creatures whose minds and bodies are better matched. As the sun rises and the warherds march from the herdstone to make war upon man, the Centigors rouse themselves from their stupors, taking up the weapons of the Beastmen and galloping to war beside them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_vmp_mortis_engine	Many Necromancers and liche-lords have risen to kingship over the Undead, becoming so saturated with evil power that their physical forms radiate magic. Some Vampires actively seek out the citadels of those lords who have gone before, hoping to take possession of their remains and to use them against the living. No mere casket or hearse could be fit to bear the remains of one of these masters of the night. Instead, they are enshrined within a Mortis Engine, a cage of fused bone, surrounded by trappings of grandeur and borne to war by a host of spirits bound to the infernal device. Some reliquaries also carry blasphemous tomes to battle, or scrolls of parchment rumoured to have been penned by Nagash himself. Oft-times the Winds of Magic become night uncontrollable when such a fell tome is near. Heavy with evil magics, painstakingly illuminated with such care that their creator's souls have passed into the leaves of human skin that form its pages, these books can be a boon to the twisted practitioners of Necromancy, but also the bane of reckless and unwary spellcasters.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_pro03_unit_long_text_vmp_krell	Krell was a mighty Chaos Champion in the days before Sigmar’s birth, the ruler of a barbarian tribe corrupted by the Chaos God, Khorne. Krell carved out an empire amongst the northern tribes before turning against the Dwarfs to the south. His name is recorded many times in the Great Book of Grudges, though he was eventually slain by the Dwarf Hero, Grimbul Ironhelm, during the assault on Karak Kadrin. Krell’s followers carried off his body to be buried in a barrow tomb, where it was found almost 1500 years later by Nagash during his searching for the Crown of Sorcery. Translating the runic inscriptions, the Necromancer set about raising this prized hero to fight in his armies. Much devastation ensued until Nagash and Krell were eventually brought to battle by Sigmar and his Dwarfen allies at the Battle of the River Reik, where Nagash was slain and his forces were all but destroyed. Although Krell and his Grave Guard fought their way off the field, Sigmar tracked, defeated and killed him at Glacier Lake. The Warrior-God entombed Krell’s body in a magical prison, where he remained until the Lichemaster Heinrich Kemmler freed him some centuries later. Naturally, Kemmler believes Krell to be his servant, forgetting that the Chaos Champion once served Nagash – allegiance to whom is not so easily broken…	true

Those Saurus Warriors blessed by Itzl have an innate aptitude for mounted warfare. They exude a musk not dissimilar to the rank odour produced by the Cold Ones themselves, allowing them to form bonds with the otherwise hostile creatures.

These nearly-bare brutes can ride through clouds of arrows and emerge unscathed (although perhaps much angrier). Even in close combat, Savage Orc Boar Boyz can withstand all but the most determined of blows. This is due to their sturdy hides, the thick-muscled, protective mounds of their smelly boar mounts, and their own mystical warpaint. While tough as old boots, Savage Orc Boar Boyz are better known for the prodigious damage they cause when they charge. They crash into enemy units with an unparalleled ferocity - boar tusks, crude axes, or flint-tipped spears that all jab, thrust and stab in a frenetic assault. In their recklessness some Savage Orcs even fight with a weapon in each hand, using their legs alone to clutch onto their mounts. These Savage Orcs are a whirling maelstrom of destruction, hacking and flailing with wild abandon - and Savage Orc Big 'Uns on war boars are more fearsome still!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_reiksguard	The Reiksguard Knights are the personal army of the Emperor. As an Elector Count, the Emperor also has direct command of his own provincial army - which in the case of Karl Franz are the regiments of Altdorf and the Reikland - but it is the Knights of the Reiksguard that form the symbol of his military strength. As befits their prestigious role and elite status, the Knights are equipped with the very finest weapons and suits of armour available. They ride fine destriers to war and the suits of gleaming plate armour in which they are clad are emblazoned with symbols of allegiance to the Emperor. Although few in number, the Reiksguard Knights are the most important part of the Emperor's army, for they are a symbol of the Empire's nobility and martial might. As such, when a unit of Reiksguard Knights takes to battle, it will typically form up proudly in the centre of the Empire battle line, the better to inspire the common soldiery and reassure them that the blessing of the Emperor is with them. 	true

The loss of his father and brothers to plague sent Ghorst into an obsessive madness; he began studying the black arts in the hope of returning his lost kith to life. Inevitably, he drew the attention of the Witch Hunter, von Kordon, and so abandoned Templehof and fled to Vargravia, taking the corpses of his brothers and father with him, determined to find a way to return them to life through Necromancy. It was here, forsaken in a corrupted land, that he attracted the attention of Mannfred von Carstein. Rather than killing Ghorst, the Count revealed further dark secrets to him, transforming Helman into something beyond the grief-maddened man from Templehof. Now, he is carried through the night on a bone-ridged cart, pulled not by horses, but by the brothers he so desperately wished to save – each a once-handsome farrier restored to a mockery of life, forced to stumble along at the head of their kin’s unloving host.	true

Rumour has it that she is the daughter of the Sea-God Manann himself; that she rose fully grown out of the waves in a froth of gore, with seawater flowing through her veins instead of blood. To others, she is simply a mutant who cut off her own fishtail after being cast out of her Norscan tribe as a child. Whatever her origins may be, her skill at a ship’s helm or with a weapon in hand is such that none can dispute her lethality in a sea battle. Having absorbed all there is to know about the art of sailing over her lifetime, she now leads the crew of her mighty square-rigged galleon known as the Swordfysh, hunting down the wolf-ships of the Norscan fleets with a cold vengeance that makes even her own crew invoke the sign of Manann for protection.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_feral_mammoth	Roaming across the frozen north are the woolly colossuses of the Old World – the gargantuan Feral Mammoths. With their elephantine trunks and great curved tusks, they are not unlike living mountains, feeding off the thorny barrens and causing the ground to quake as they follow their endless migration paths. The Northmen frequently seek them out as abandoned calves, for if a mammoth is trained early enough, it can be brought into battle as a highly effective trampling weapon that can easily reduce enemies to bloody ground-smears. Exposure to Chaos-tainted materials has resulted in some of the species mutating into larger and more aggressive versions of the regular feral variety, sometimes sprouting extra horns that make them desirable to be ridden into battle as War Mammoths.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_cha_khainite_assassin_0	Assassins are masters of a subtle and murderous magic, trained from infancy to be the chosen warriors of Khaine. They move silently and with a precision that surpasses even the standards of other Elves. Blindfolded, an Assassin can walk sure-footedly across the spears of an embattled phalanx, or strike a precise flurry of blows so that each cut exploits a different weakness of armour or flesh. Assassins are also masters of using poison, and they coat their weapons in a variety of toxins - some are deadly, others paralyse or stupefy their victim. One scratch from some of these poisons is enough to send a man into agonising paroxysms as his nerves burn, his heart explodes or his bones crack and shatter. Assassins take great pleasure in the awful demises of their victims and often keep prisoners alive for many days. Often, they extract confessions and information from captives much more quickly than the crude tortures used by other Naggarothi interrogators.	true

They have a knowledge of the wilderness unsurpassed by even the most intelligent Gor, and it is they who sow the seeds of mayhem, seeds that soon blossom into full-blown destruction once the warherd falls upon its victims. Bands of Ungor Raiders range ahead of the warherd as it travels through the lands, sending runners back and forth to ensure the Beastmen army can bring its might to bear at the right place and time. Intelligence provided by Ungor Raiders enables the warherds to encircle and trap the foe, to launch ambushes from hidden paths and moss-choked vales, and to cut off the escape routes of those that believe there is still a route to safety.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_shaman	An Orc Shaman is a living conduit to Gork and Mork and can wield such arcane might that even the cruellest old Warbosses have to be impressed. The power of a Shaman comes not just from the Winds of Magic, or "da Great Green" as Greenskins know it, but also from the raw energy radiated by their fellow Orcs. As they advance into battle, the Waaagh! energy rises, allowing a Shaman to focus that force through the power of his mind. What erupts out of the Shaman are spells as brutal as the Orcs themselves. Shamans have been known to cause a foe's brains to burst out of his skull, to shoot death beams out of their own beady eyes or to summon an almighty green foot from the skies to stomp and squish any unfortunate enough to be caught underneath it. By using the awesome powers of Greenskin magic to destroy an enemy, Orc Shamans earn the right to their eccentricities.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_demigryph_knights	Whilst many of the monstrous creatures ridden by the heroes of the Empire have been raised from birth, such is not always the case with demigryphs. Amongst some Knightly Orders, an aspiring Knight's final trial is to capture a demigryph and break it up to his will. Unsurprisingly, many fail and are torn to bloody ribbons. As a result, there are relatively few Demigryph Knights in the Empire and even the Knights Griffon, who count fully two dozen of these majestic beasts amongst their number, still rely primarily on more conventional steeds. However, those few small Orders, such as the Knights of Taal's Fury and the Knights of the Vengeful Sun, whose entire brotherhoods can take to war upon these monstrous beasts, have a roll of victory honours surpassed only by the most ancient of Knightly Orders. Demigryph Knights do not tend to overwhelm their prey in great sweeping charges. Instead they are more likely to engage the enemy in protracted assaults where the strength and endurance of their fearsome mounts becomes decisive. Demigryphs are well suited to the savage and bloody nature of such fighting, with their claws and razor sharp beaks cutting a bloody swathe through their foes. In such close confines, a Knight's traditional lance loses much of its effectiveness, and many Demigryph Knights have thusly adapted their fighting style to wield heavy cavalry halberds in battle instead. These weapons strike the perfect balance between reach and power, and are far better suited to the Knight's role on the battlefield.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_mourngul_haunter	Mourngul Haunters are feared above all other dangers that haunt the bleak, empty places of the Old World. From the cold wastes of Norsca to the lofty heights of the Grey Mountains, dreadful tales are told around huddled fires of those lost in the white killing cold of mountain winters, driven mad by famine and pain, devouring their own companions and former friends for meat and the warmth of their fast-flowing blood. For these damned souls, there is no salvation. When bodily death overtakes the stranded and desperate, such is their anguish and malice that it lingers on, and the most destructive Winds of Magic are drawn to coil around their spirits to taint and saturate them. With their cadavers becoming warped and twisted into inhuman proportions, they transform into something neither ghost nor revenant – a monstrous, razor-thin shadow of cold, dead flesh and frostbite-cracked bone, with a gaping maw of needle-teeth and a cavernous stomach that hangs open like a dreadful wound.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_art_casket_of_souls	At the heart of each tomb of the mightiest king there lies a casket, inscribed with hieroglyphs of malediction. Within this sarcophagus resides the tormented souls of those who have incited a Tomb King's wrath. Powerful binding inscriptions ensure that these souls cannot leave their prison until the moment when the casket is opened. When a Casket of Souls is opened, blinding light spills across the battlefield as countless souls scream into the air seeking freedom from the suffering of their confinement. These spirits plunge through the bodies of the Tomb Kings' enemies, and the hapless victims suffer unbearable agony as their life essence is utterly drained. To die thus is far worse than a physical death, for the very souls of those who perish in this manner become ensnared by the power of the casket. A Casket of Souls is a devastating weapon, for all who look upon it risk eternal damnation and imprisonment.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_wight_king	Wight Kings are incredibly powerful Undead, almost as hard to destroy as Vampires. Suffused with Dark Magic, a Wight King's weapons shimmer with baleful energy. The merest touch of their spear tip or blade can drain the life from their foes, or slice through flesh and bone with an ease that is frightening to behold. Clad in ancient armour, their flesh all but withered away, there is little for an adversary to cut or stab. Even to stand before one of these skeletal warriors of antiquity takes an extreme effort of will. For these reasons, a Vampire will often charge a Wight King with carrying forth the Undead general's personal banner. Such a duty is often integral to the army's stability, and  these indomitable Undead warriors are able to hold aloft the army standard whilst tirelessly striking down one foe after another.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_skeletons	Beneath the mud lie the grave-stained bones of bitter, ancient warriors. Long held beneath the earth, they are clad in their corroded armour, their lifeless hands still gripping the swords, axes, spears and shields they held in life. Provided their remains have not been blessed by the rites of Morr, a Necromancer or Vampire can use the coiling energies of Dark Magic to instil a semblance of life and a flicker of spirit into these dormant warriors. As the regiments of past massacres claw their way to the surface, their empty eye sockets glow with unholy power. Silently, they gather together in a semblance of their old ranks, mutely awaiting the commands of their new lord as the remains of their tattered banners flap in the unnatural breeze of their creation. Lipless horn blowers raise their instruments and sound a spectral, mournful dirge.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_glade_riders	The Glade Riders are perhaps the greatest horse-warriors of the world, their Elven reflexes allowing them to perform an incredible variety of seemingly reckless acts that are far beyond the abilities of lesser races. Whether firing backwards while riding full pelt through deep woods or darting through the ranks of surprised enemy outriders, Glade Riders routinely survive their escapades unscathed through a formidable combination of graceful skill and unflappable confidence.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_frost_wyrm	The mutating power of Chaos has touched more than just trolls and wolves in the malign wilderness of Troll Country. In its northern reaches, just below the surface of the frozen tundra, Frost-Wyrms lurk in their underground lairs. With the appearance of giant, winged monsters, nobody is entirely sure of their true nature or origins, but they are certainly abominable creatures tainted by Chaos. Some say that before the species mutated, they may have been Ice Dragons – a creature with a similarly dangerous killing ability in its icy, freezing breath, and a gargantuan size proportional to its age. Lying motionless beneath the frozen tundra, the cold-blooded Frost-Wyrm waits for the footfalls of trespassers before emerging to freeze them to death in their tracks.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_peasant_mob	The life of a Bretonnian peasant is thankless, impoverished and - if the gods are merciful - short. Yet it is their duty to labour for, pay tribute to, and die in service of their Liege. Yet although a life spent toiling the land for pitiful gain is a damnable existence, it pales next to a day upon the battlefield. And indeed, should a duke ride to war, he will surely drag his droves of human chattel along with him. These hapless wanderers are then assuredly butchered in their multitudes as fodder to their Lord's worthy cause. To make their numbers count, peasants are ordered into huddled units on the battlefield, which makes up for their lack of training and skill. Like Men-At-Arms, Peasant Mobs are not very reliable if left to their own devices, but under the stern gaze of a Knight can aspire to adequate, though not exceptional, deeds.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_dire_wolves	Dire Wolves are macabre parodies of the living Giant Wolves that roam the Badlands and the forests of the Old World. Their flesh hangs in tatters from cracking bones, their skulls and innards exposed through tears in their skin. They are swathed in an eerie, glimmering twilight and their eyes glow with unnatural energy. The stench of putrefaction hangs on their wet breath and their howls cause shivers of fear to freeze the bold. When they are slain, their bodies dissolve into a coiling miasma, leaving nothing behind. Vampires sometimes keep the largest of these creatures in pens deep below their castles and towers, feeding them on local peasants until they are large and glutted, then goading them to new heights of viciousness. The Vampire imbue their creations with Dark Magic to increase vitality and bestow a callous cunning. These monstrous creations are known as Doom Wolves, and it is these larger, more ferocious beasts that lead the Dire Wolf packs to war.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_mon_war_hydra_0	The Hydra is a titanic beast of the mountains, whose ill-tempered and ravenous nature has proven the doom of many an unsuspecting morsel. Indeed, so ferocious is the Hydra that campaigning armies often make wide detours to avoid intruding on such a beast's bone-strewn lair. Those that march on regardless do so either out of confidence in their battle-prowess or ignorance of the Hydra's savagery. War Hydras are notoriously difficult for their handlers to control, and a Beastmaster must be quick with his lash lest he be devoured in the enemy's stead. They are even more difficult to slay, for not only are their scaly bodies incredibly well armoured, they also regenerate damage at a frightening rate. A foe's only chance is to sever all the monsters heads in quick succession - if even a single one remains, the remainder will swiftly gross back and devour the impudent attacker for his troubles.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_branchwraith	Branchwraiths are the oldest of the Dryads. They have ever served as the handmaidens to the Ancients of Athel Loren, and attend to the Treemen with a dedication bordering upon the fanatical. Yet before the coming of the Elves, the Branchwraiths were so much more. In those days, it was they who ruled the forest and they who tamed the Winds of Magic to bring sustenance to bough and branch. Thusly, few Branchwraiths think kindly of the Elves, and many hate them - it matters not that Durthu brought the Elves into the forest precisely because he knew that the Branchwraiths' cruel nature would lead Athel Loren to great evil. Now the Branchwraiths watch and wait for the seasons to shift once again. One day soon, they believe, the usurpers will be cast down from their lofty perches and the natural order restored.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_feral_manticore	Manticores are huge, leonine beasts that soar on leathery wings. They are amongst the most powerful of all the predators that live in the north’s mountain ranges. The mutating power of Chaos ensures that no two Manticores are truly alike. Some have manes of writhing serpents, others pelts of iron scales, and many sprout spiked tales with a poison strong enough to boil a man’s blood in his veins. However, all Manticores are berserk killers saturated with primal fury. They are so fierce that they are held by the Dark Elves to be incarnations of Khaine, God of Murder.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_savage_orcs	It isn't just their appearance that is wild, for Savage Orcs drum and chant themselves into a bloodthirsty rage before a battle. While other Greenskins might find their backward customs odd, all agree that Savage Orcs are ferocious fighters. Once engaged in combat, they beat foes enthusiastically with hefty clubs and stone axes, or stab at them with flint-tipped spears. Some Savage Orcs use bows, firing stone-tipped arrows to fell enemies from afar. They are also known to employ a Big Stabba, a two-Orc team carrying a long spear. This, traditionally, has been used for hunting since the lands were full of enormous reptilian beasts. Back then, Savage Orcs like to recall, "Orcs wuz Orcs and beasts wuz big!" Some tribes can boast of a mob of Savage Orc Big 'Uns, the fiercest fighters often marked with the most outlandish warpaint or bearing a larger number of shrunken heads, bangles or other fetishes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_inf_black_guard_0	The Black Guard are Malekith's personal army, answerable to no other save he. They are recruited from the offspring of families high in the Witch King's favour, taken at birth from mothers who are soon thereafter put to the sword. With no family ties to distract them, these children are raised within the barracks of the Black Guard and taught the myriad skills of death and destruction that are required of Malekith's foremost elite. The barracks of the Black Guard are divided into twenty towers which compete against each other in contests of war and torture. The Witch King grimly encourages competition between the towers and each year, at the beginning of the Season of Blood, a tournament is held to determine which tower will hold dominance over the others for the coming year. The leaders of these factions are the Tower Masters, veterans of the Black Guard so inculcated with death and battle that they choose to continue in Malekith's service after their two centuries of duty have been completed. These hardened warriors rule their underlings with a will of iron, determined that their tower shall not be shamed by lack of discipline - or worse, a glimmer of mercy - on the part of their charges.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_quarrellers	When the Clans are called to fight, some Dwarfs arm themselves with crossbows and join the battle as Quarrellers. These formations are tasked with raining bolts down upon their foes - a task they perform with orderly zeal. Quarrellers seek to thin down the enemy's ranks, punish units attempting to outflank their own forces and engage in ranged duels with the foe's missile-armed troops. Dwarfs have never taken to bows, partly because they do not suit their short physical stature, but also due to the limitations of such weapons in confined tunnels. The powerfully-built Dwarf crossbow can easily fire shots that outdistance the puny bows used by Goblins, and the crossbow bolts pack enough punch to devastate lightly armoured foes. With typical Dwarf precision, a unit of Quarrellers will unleash its hail of bolts, reload, take aim and fire again. Protected by heavy armour and their own sturdy constitutions, it is a rare day when an enemy - even one with more skilled marksmen than the Dwarfs - can win a long-ranged shooting contest against a unit of Quarrellers. Of course, should the enemy approach near enough to engage the Quarrellers in close combat, they will find hardened warriors eager to put their axes to work. While the devotees to the handgun have grown over the years, they have not replaced the crossbow. There are many Clans that prefer the range of the crossbow, while the most traditionalist simply rile against any technological progress and the regrettable lack of "elbow grease" needed to fire a handgun instead of winding a crossbow winch to reset its formidable shot. Not surprisingly, some of the less wealthy Clans even grumble over the cost of black powder.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cha_prince_5	The noble families of Ulthuan have led the High Elves through times of peace and conflict for thousands of years. They pride themselves on a deep sense of honour, as well as the mastery of both diplomacy and war as art forms. The High Elves believe an existence lived without precision to be hollow, and scarcely preferable to death. Any Elven aristocrat is just at home fighting with sword in bloody melee as he is loosing deathly-accurate arrows from afar, or even dictating the strategy from a greater distance still. Depending on their wealth and the kingdom of their birth, the princes and princesses of Ulthuan fight in many different ways. Those of Tiranoc typically do battle from the back of swift-wheeled chariots, while the lords of Lothern often stand, spear and bow in hand, amidst the ranks of the Sea Guard. Those with the greatest wealth might ride upon a Great Eagle or Griffon or, in the case of the mightiest princes and princesses of Caledor, a Dragon. Such steeds are invariably a symbol of status, as well as lending a brutal advantage in the midst of battle.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_inf_phoenix_guard	The Phoenix Guard are the guardians of the Shrine of Asuryan, the great pyramid temple in the Sea of Dreams. Deep within lies the Chamber of Days. On its ancient walls, it is said, are the histories of past, present and future, etched in words of fire. Legend tells that any who behold that wall shall forever be cursed with the knowledge of their own death. Regiments of Phoenix Guard are always found where the fighting is fiercest and victory hardest won, for their gift allows them to see confluences and crux points upon the battlefield that lie hidden to mortal eyes. Each warrior knows his appointed hour of death, but none seek to delay that fatal moment. Whether battle brings victory or defeat, life or death, the Phoenix Guard fight on without fear.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_cha_dreadlord_5	Dreadlords and masters are the so-called noble-born rulers of Naggaroth. They range from sycophantic schemers to masterful strategists who have waged war across a hundred battlefields. Though all such nobles pursue their own unique enthusiasms and ambitions, they are without exception selfish individuals, possessed of an arrogance matched only by their martial prowess, honed over centuries of unceasing war. Many Dreadlords owe their position of power to their bloodlines, daring exploits, or the Witch King's mercurial favours. Others are granted temporary power by means of a writ of iron - an edict granted by one of the six rulers of the great cities of Naggaroth. He who bears a writ of iron shares the sponsor's authority - a powerful tool for the ambitious. However, should a Dark Elf fail in his appointed task, or show cowardice whilst acting in his sponsor's name, the writ is melted down and the molten remains poured down his throat. Such is the price of failure in Naggaroth.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_outriders	Outriders are grim men who are both the commanders and drill instructors of the Pistolkorps. Outriders are rarely noblemen, but rather they are veterans elevated from the ranks of the state regiments, sergeants and officers who have shown an affinity for horsemanship and a talent for training new recruits. Outriders typically wear ornate armour, for noblemen pay well for their sons to learn the art of war. They also tend to sport eccentrically waxed moustaches to differentiate themselves from their younger charges. Outriders also form into separate regiments, sometimes to show their charges exactly how it's done, but also to display their own martial discipline to any noblemen in the army that might be looking for an experienced instructor to tutor their own sons. As the Pistolkorps is funded in part by the Imperial Engineers School, Outriders are equipped with deadly repeater handguns, weapons capable of unleashing devastating storms of lead at long range. The leader of the Outriders, inevitably the keenest shot in the regiment, will often be armed with an even more outlandish weapon as befits his status, gifted to him by a patron engineer.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_rock_lobber	Orcs and Goblins were introduced to catapults, or “fings wot throw roks”, shortly after they encountered the Dwarfs. Greenskins are not technically minded (particularly Orcs), but they have a great appetite for destruction. Even as boulders splattered their foes, Orcs and Goblins began to wish for some catapults of their own. Since then, the Greenskins have built a plethora of what they generally refer to as “lobbers”. These are deployed either singly or in batteries to soften up enemy formations, smash defensive positions, or to toss those that offend the Warboss very, very far. A great shot, one that pulverises a large amount of the foes or sends body pieces flying particularly high, always raises a rowdy cheer. Most Rock Lobbers are counterweight devices, although some use twisted rope to generate torque. Experiments with Troll-powered devices have been tried, but such creatures tend to eat either the animation or key parts of the machine (or both). Some war engines, especially those that have launched spectacularly bloody shots, are given names, such as the legendary Skull Crusher, Fings Chucker, and Hammer of Gork. The Rock Lobber known as Da Boss’ Bane, named for its habit of landing off target and smashing the tribe’s Warboss, was burned, along with its crew, as a precautionary measure by an unusually bright new leader.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cav_cold_ones_feral_0_summoned	Cold Ones are rapacious predators, fuelled by a savage blood-lust that drives them to attack any warm-blooded creature that comes near. They hunt in packs, and are perfectly capable of bringing down creatures many times their own size. As soon as they become aware of their prey, the pack will surge forth, some of their number harrying and snapping at their quarry, while the rest of the pack swings forward to left and right. Once surrounded, the unfortunate victim will quickly be dragged down and consumed. Cold Ones can be broken to the saddle, and are used as cavalry mounts by both the Dark Elves and Lizardmen. However, breaking them in this way tempers their normally savage nature, and although still ferocious compared to most mounts, it leaves them dull-eyed and sullen compared to their wild cousins. For this reason, Wizards will sometimes bind packs of feral Cold Ones to their will with a Scroll of Binding, and then unleash them at the start of a battle to surge uncontrollably forward and savagely attack the foe. Used in this way, a large pack of Cold Ones can inflict terrible harm, while smaller packs are ideal for snapping and biting at the flanks of the opposing army.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_arachnarok_spider	The darkest forests of the world are the home to the Gigantic Spiders. These venomous creatures grow to an enormous size, sucking the life juices out of prey and leaving behind only skin-husks and bones. A full-grown Gigantic Spider is larger than a Troll, and its whole body is protected by chitinous armour plates. All Gigantic Spiders have a poisonous bite that is used to paralyse their prey. Only the most foolhardy would attempt to seek them out, and Forest Goblin Shamans, with their spectacular lack of common sense, fit well into that category. A gifted Shaman, touched by the Spider-god's blessings, will not be turned into a lifeless husk, but instead may be rewarded with a clutch of spiderlings. This foul brood - each spider already the size of a horse's head - can be reared and trained. When fully grown, these Gigantic Spiders are prized as revered mounts for a Goblin tribe's mightiest warriors.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_doom_diver_catapult	The height of the Doom Diver can reach is largely dependent on the quality of his hand-stitched leather wings and, perhaps even more importantly, how far back his crew can pull him on the sinew. It has been known for over zealous types to pull the entire device from its mounts - but more often than not the Doom Diver is stretched back to the limits of the crew's strength and let go with a loud TWANG! Ripping skywards like a bullet, the Doom Diver reaches cloud level before beginning his dive. Using his wings, the gobbo spirals and guides himself towards the chosen target. As the downward descent gains speed, most Goblins emit a high-pitched scream that grows louder and more irritating as it plummets earthwards. With worrying rapidity, the black speck in the sky expands into the plunging Doom Diver. When the Goblin finally impacts, the Greenskin himself might splatter altogether or, if he has effectively applied his wings as brakes and is a bit lucky, he might bounce. Either way a Doom Diver is likely to cause considerable damage to any foe he lands upon.	true

With some reconfiguration, and by losing the heavy weight of the steam gun, the Engineers' Guild were able to significantly increase the size and number of bombs carried. Thus was the Gyrobomber invented. Armed with their impressive bomb racks and a nose-mounted clatterygun, the Gyrobombers stream over the Dwarf battle lines seeking to obliterate the foe's largest formations. Already, several flying formations have become famous - perhaps most notably the Skyhammers from Zhufbar and the Blackhammer Bombers and Karaz-a-Karak.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_mon_great_eagle	The Great Eagles of Ulthuan have always been firm allies to the High Elves. The histories tell that the two races have fought in one another's cause since the time of the Daemon invasion, but legend carries the friendship deeper into the past. Indeed, in some tales, it was Talyn, King of the Eagles, who bore Ereth Khial away to the Underworld at Asuryan's command. Like the High Elves, Great Eagles are haughty creatures who long remember insults, and do not suffer foolish company gladly. When High Elf armies assemble, the noble Eagles too join the battle. They swoop down upon the crew of enemy war machines, tearing them apart with powerful talons before using mighty wings to glide swiftly away.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_cha_shadow_walker_0	The Shadow Warriors, Alith Anar’s masters of irregular warfare, are the elite warriors of the Elven race. From among their number, the Shadow King raises up the greatest warrior with the greatest grasp of strategy and tactics to be his ‘hand’, who advises him and carries out his will with a furious precision. On those occasions where Alith Anar’s force must split into two, the Hand of the Shadow Crown leads the second contingent, bringing death to the Dark Elves with the same ruthless efficiency as his unswerving liege.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_chaos_warhounds	In the dark forests, twisted Warhounds stalk the night in search of prey. Their red, evilly-glinting eyes peer from the treeline, and saliva pools upon the litter-strewn ground as they taste the air for the scent of their next victim. Many a lone patrolman travelling in the woods at night has shivered at the sound of baleful howling in the distance, only to be confronted by the low growling of the pack that had crept up behind him whilst he was distracted. Regardless of form, Warhounds are all vicious killers and their harsh baying is a sure warning of the slaughter to come. They bound across the battlefield at an alarming speed, so a Handgunner will have scant moments to take his shot and no hope of reloading before their powerful claws rake him to the ground and knife-like fangs close around his throat.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cha_loremaster_of_hoeth_0	The Loremasters of Hoeth are invariably gifted warriors, for their intellects find even the exacting disciplines of the Swordmasters almost childishly easy to master. Similarly, each Loremaster has a faultless grasp of the principles of magical lore. However, he seldom wastes time in committing more than a sliver of battle magic to memory, being more concerned with weightier and more elusive spells that are little suited to the battlefield. Within the Tower of Hoeth can be found many disciplines of art, magic and war. Most scholars confine themselves to studying but a single path, honing their skills until perfection is achieved. Even amongst the rarefied Elven ranks, it is unusual to find an intellect capable of mastering an entire path, let alone show accomplishment in several, but it is not impossible. Such is the achievement that marks out a Loremaster from a mere scholar.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_warboss	Orcs are led by the biggest and brawniest of their kind. These hulking individuals have pummelled their way to the top in a culture where only the strongest survive. Orc leaders do not rise above the knock-down brawls so common amongst their race, they thrive on them - at least until they are toppled by a still mightier challenger. Having established dominance over all competitors, Orc leaders take control of a mob or, if they are strong enough, an entire tribe. Any who question the right of the leader to rule must be slain, driven off or spectacularly beaten into submission.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc06_unit_long_text_chs_marauder_horsemasters	Some tribes of Marauders hold horses in high esteem, while others regard them with fear and superstition. To many, a warhorse is a sign of status, and only the best warriors may ride them. The steeds ridden by these tribes are powerful beasts, foul-tempered and strong of limb. Once a rider has broken such a horse, it will remain loyal to him until death, but they remain vicious and unruly should a stranger approach. Fed on a diet of human flesh and watered-down blood, these snorting, high-spirited steeds have a glint of intelligent menace in their eyes, and will trample, kick and bite as if berserk when engaged at close quarters. In battle, their speed and mobility leaves even the most able cavalrymen of the Old World sorely lacking. Able to steer their steeds with the subtlest of movements of the waist and knees, the tribesmen have both hands free to wield wicked blades and hooked axes.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_arkhan	Arkhan the Black, known now and forever as the Liche King, was the first and most loyal of the evil Nagash's followers. He helped lead the coup which brought the arch-necromancer to power, and he was the first, after his Lord, to imbibe the Elixir of Life. Arkhan was the most adept of Nagash's pupils in the study of dark sorcery, and he quickly rose to become the necromancer's trusted vizier and principal lieutenant. He led many armies against Nagash's enemies and was never defeated in open combat. In the end, however, the sheer numbers of the Priest Kings' soldiers forced Nagash to retreat. It was Arkhan who led the suicidal counter-attack that gave Nagash the opportunity to escape. For over an hour he held back the Army of the Seven Kings through feats of martial prowess and powerful sorcery. Arkhan finally fell, not to a hero's sword, but to a single spear hurled by an unknown soldier. He stared in horror at the shaft protruding from his chest, knowing that it had pierced his heart. With his dying breath, he threatened that a terrible curse would befall any who touched his corpse, and with that, he slumped to the ground. Within seconds, dark flames had consumed Arkhan's flesh leaving behind only a blackened skeleton. Whilst the rest of Nagash's followers were beheaded and burnt, none dared risk desecrating Arkhan's remains, and so they covered them under a cairn of stones instead. Nagash did not forget his most able lieutenant, and when he returned to wreak vengeance on Nehekhara, Arkhan was reborn as the Liche King - the first of Nagash's nine Dark Lords. These foul beings were the foremost of Nagash's captains, and they brought despair and destruction to his foes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_inf_skink_skirmishers_blessed_0	Skittish and quick, Skinks stand out from the rest of the sluggish Lizardmen. They are the mass workforce designed by the Old Ones to perform many different roles, and without them, Lizardmen society would quickly collapse. Skinks take up weapons during their many patrols as well as to join the fighting during times of war. As troops, they range between reckless audacity and sudden panic. Their skittish nature makes them much more prone to routing than the stoic Saurus. Most commonly, the Skinks advance before the bulk of the main army, harassing the foe's advance with hails of darts. When massed together in a fighting cohort, they can bulk out a Lizardmen battleline. The volleys of javelins and darts that the Skinks can unleash are astoundingly dangerous, for they have learned to coat their weapons with lethal toxins distilled from venomous amphibians, insects and serpents that thrive in the steamy jungle and profuse swamps of Lustria.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_vargheists	Vargheists are the darkness in a Vampire's soul made manifest. They are towering winged humanoids, each several times the size of a man. Though the Vargheists once walked and talked as lords amongst the chattel, these curse-born Vampires have devolved into ravenous predators desperate for the taste of blood. They prowl the battlefield in packs, ready to pounce upon the least sign of weakness and tear a hole in the enemy ranks with crimson claw and bloody fang.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_def_mon_feral_manticore_0	Dark Elves hold no creature in higher esteem than the Manticore, for they believe it to be one of the thousand incarnations of Khaine; daring Beastmasters venture as far north as the Chaos Wastes in search of young Manticores to sell at auction. Manticores can be tamed enough to take a rider, though they remain feral. Even if a steed occasionally ignores its rider's commands and pitches them into unfavourable fights, a Dark Elf considers this a minor risk compared to the fear and respect brought about by bringing a fearsome mount to the fray.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc02_unit_long_text_vmp_blood_knights	Blood Knights are the most fearsome cavalry in all of the Old World. The training and discipline they received in life is enhanced by the unnatural speed and strength of the Vampiric curse. Blood Knights are nigh-on indestructible, riding with fangs bared through storms of arrow and shot. Such is their honour that they will refuse no martial challenge and will fight at the forefront of an Undead army without question. It is said that even the fabled Grail Knights of Bretonnia cannot match the Blood Knights lance-for-lance upon the field. Over time, the Blood Knights have become a macabre parody of the virtuous Templars that Walach turned. Though they retain the Dragon as their symbol, with blazons and crests in their likeness, their armour is encrusted with images of death and slaughter. Their blades are fell weapons inscribed with dark runes, chased with precious metals and fashioned in the likenesses of evil beasts. The Knights do not ride flesh-and-blood horses, but instead charge across the field of battle upon evil Nightmares clad in thick barding painted with the disturbing icons of necromantic power.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_prophetess	Damsels and Prophetesses are powerful individuals, for in their years away from Bretonnia, their innate abilities have been honed and tempered. Their magic is orientated around nature more so than most other human Wizards, for they are taught by the handmaidens of the Lady. Riding into battle, Damsels and Prophetesses use their powers to lend magical protection to Bretonnia's noble warriors, warding away the foul magic of their enemies as well as casting them down with powerful spells of their own. They are also able to mystically encourage the landscape to fight the kingdom's enemies; persuading the trees themselves to lash out at the foe; calling flocks of birds to descend on the enemy at their call; even drawing lightning from the heavens to strike down in devastating arcs.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_bestigor_herd	The strongest and meanest of the Beastmen footsoldiers are known as Bestigors. Their size and ferocity means they carve a privileged position within the warherd, enforcing their superiority over the Gors and Ungors with random acts of excessive violence. In battle, Bestigors form a solid, armoured mass of muscle and iron that charges forward with a terrifying momentum. They seek out the elite of the enemy army - who inherently challenge their dominant status - then wield their huge axes like executioner's blades, hewing the foe limb from limb and trampling their broken bodies into the mud beneath their unshod hooves.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_settra	Settra, known by many godly titles such as Settra the Imperishable, the King of Kings, High King of Nehekhara, Lord of the Earth, Monarch of the Sky, Ruler of the Four Horizons, Mighty Lion of the Infinite Desert, Great Hawk of the Heavens, Majestic Emperor of the Shifting Sands, Eternal Sovereign of Khemri's legions, and so much more, is the mighty and absolute sovereign ruler of all Nehekhara, an ancient and powerful warrior-king who ruled a large and powerful Empire some two-thousand five hundred years before the birth of the Barbarian Hero Sigmar Heldenhammer and the founding of the Empire. Settra is as ruthless and tyrannical a ruler as can ever be, whose thirst for conquest and power is only matched by that of Nagash himself. His power is far greater than any other Tomb King, and his unyielding will is such that he never needs to return to his sarcophagus to rest. The immortality he lusted after in life is now his, and the civilisations that flourished in his absence will soon known the full wrath of he who founded the first.	true

Competition for positions in the Dark Convent is bloody and fierce. Those that survive their sisters' ambitions learn some of the most powerful magic in the world. They can call upon ancient daemonic entities to devour their enemies, hurl storms of wicked shards at their foes or engulf them in dark energy. The Dark Magics of sorcery are but one of the disciplines studied by the Sorceresses of Ghrond, and they can call upon the Lores of Battle Magic with just as much skill as the stiff-souled mages of Ulthuan.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_sarthorael	Although no Daemon’s true name can ever be known, there has been talk for aeons of the one called “Sarthorael”. Like all Lords of Change, the Ever-Watcher revels in his contriving and devious nature, hiding his true manipulative genius behind a screen of erratic and fickle behaviour. Yet Sarthorael is more than a mere Lord of Change - he is one of Tzeentch’s favoured, sent to spread mayhem to those that the Great Changer deems deserving. Whilst the world of mortals should tremble when a Lord of Change appears before them, so too should Daemons be wary, for Tzeentch does not discriminate – all are fair targets in his game. And so Sarthorael is sent, watching and waiting, with all the craft and slyness of his master, to judge whether the end can really be brought about and, when the time is right, to see if those who stand upon the wastes really have the strength to do it.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_rotting_leviathan	A living Leviathan is truly a sight to behold. With the appearance of an immense crab typically measuring at least thirty feet across, its seaweed-strewn carapace is said to be as strong as steel. With beady eyes searching upon stunted stalks, it hunts for prey to grab with its claws and shove into its gaping maw. Although there was once a cult dedicated to worshipping them, Leviathans are thought not to be creatures of Chaos, just naturally destructive ones. Scholars believe that the few which exist live on the deepest sea floors, only ever rising to the surface to wreak havoc on passing galleons. In any case, it is notoriously difficult to control a living Leviathan – only once felled and killed can a Necromancer hope to bring one under their command with the appropriate incantations, a feat only achievable by the most learned magic-users.	true

The fame of those twin brothers extends throughout Ulthuan and into the lands beyond. Born into one of the oldest families of Ulthuan, the brothers can trace their line back to the doomed Aenarion, first and mightiest of the Phoenix Kings of Ulthuan. It is their destiny to perform mighty deeds and shape the fate of kingdoms. Prince Tyrion is the High Elves' greatest living warrior. So valiant and skilled is he that the bards of Ulthuan sing that he is nothing less than Aenarion reborn - a tale that is given credence far beyond Ulthuan's shores. Since Tyrion's meteoric rise to fame, many have whispered of his destiny to lead the High Elves towards a glorious future, and perhaps one day to take the Phoenix Crown. If Tyrion hears such gossip, he pays it no heed, for he is unswervingly loyal to Finubar. Thus does Tyrion concern himself only with the twin duties of protecting Ulthuan and its Everqueen. However, the latter is seen less as a duty than it is a calling of the heart - it is common knowledge that Tyrion is Alarielle's consort, and has been for many years.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_ungor_herd	Ungors (meaning 'no-horns' in the Beastmen tongue) are not as strong or robust of frame as the Gors, but they more than make up for it in sheer malevolence. They are physically smaller than other Beastmen and their horns, if they have any, are less impressive and numerous. While Gors may have long and spectacular horns as deadly as any sword, Ungors usually have short prongs or horn buds sprouting from their skulls, not recognisable as those of a goat or any other type of beast acknowledged by the Gors. Due to this, they are not considered to be 'proper' Beastmen. The race of men, on the other hand, does not draw such distinctions. To them the Ungors are just as horrible, horns or no, for they are twisted aberrations of nature that live to murder and despoil all that is good and wholesome. Ungors are considerably more dextrous than their fellows, their sinewy hands able to carve runes, build wooden structures, and fix and bind the weaponry of their clumsier Gor brethren. So it is that Ungors fulfil a vital role in the society of the tribe, for without them, the herd would soon be bereft of weaponry. Most Ungors take to the field in large herds, arming themselves with stout spears with which to impale their prey and carrying crude shields to protect their grotesque pot-bellied bodies. In battle, Ungors are bullied into a semblance of order by the largest of their number, known as Halfhorns, who seeks a position in the battle line from which they can inflict the most pain and suffering upon the foe.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_goblin_wolf_bows	Goblin Wolf Riders are dangerously fast, able to outride all other beasts save perhaps the swift steeds of the Elves. Some Wolf Rider mobs use bows to fill their enemies with arrows. They lope into range, unleash a hail of arrows, and then retreat before the foe can respond. Wolf Riders often harass the flanks of oncoming troops, but have also been known to charge into smaller (and more vulnerable) units such as war machines and enemy scouts. Other Wolf Rider mobs are more heavily armoured and these Goblins will dare to lower their spears and attack larger formations, howling as they crash headlong into enemy troops. However, it is often said that the snarling wolves are more formidable foes than the Goblins who ride atop their shaggy backs. More than one Warboss has found out that "dog boyz" are not always reliable, finding Wolf Riders as quick to leave the battlefield as they are to launch an attack.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_veh_skeleton_chariot	The pride of a Tomb King's army is his charioteer legions. Their advance is heralded by a cloud of dust thrown high in the air as they drive across the sands. Moments later, units of these deadly machines crest the dunes, their wheels whirring as they careen towards their foe. The legions impact with bone-shattering force, wave after wave of chariots crushing bodies beneath heavy wheels as their Undead crew lay about the disorientated foe with lethal effect. Ever since their invention, chariots have been the chosen means of transport for the kings of Nehekhara. Upon awakening from their deathly slumbers, the Tomb Kings continue to lead their armies to war from atop these ancient machines. Not only does a chariot have an armoured carriage to protect them from harm as they slay their foes, it also provides an elevated platform, granting the Undead monarchs a superior view of the battlefield, enabling them to better witness the movements of enemy fortifications and direct their own troops to inflict the most damage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_men_at_arms	Each Midsummer, commoners flock to their Lord's castle to present their sons in the hope that they will be trained as Men-at-Arms. For a peasant to have a son accepted into the ranks of a Knight's household is a great honour. Some young peasants will have been guided towards this goal through their entire life, encouraged to stand up straighter and taller than the usual peasant 'slouch' to better improve their chances of selection. All morning and afternoon the Knight inspects the candidates. By dusk, the luckiest and strongest are selected and are taken back to the castle where they are given basic training and outfitted in the livery of their Lord.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cav_dragon_princes	Long ago, Ulthuan was dominated by the valorous deeds and wise rule of Caledor's Dragon Princes. Now, the royal bloodline has faded, and the power of Dragons has diminished, but Caledor's pride still shines bright. Where they once rode Dragons, today they ride to war upon swift horses. Both mount and rider wear crested ithilmar armour whose style echoes that of the Dragons riders of old. This Dragon armour is forged in the heart of Vaul's Anvil, where ancient enchantments are bound into the cooling ithilmar, ensuring that no lesser flame than the fires of Vaul can offer harm to the armour or its wearer.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_forest_dragon	Nothing dwells for long in Athel Loren without being changed, and the Forest Dragons are no exception. Like certain groups of Wood Elves, the Dragons have slowly become an extension of the forest's will to survive and prosper. Though still voracious predators, the Dragons hunt only when the forest has need of them, resting in a state of hibernation for the remainder of the time. Should there be an intrusion by creatures too mighty for Athel Loren's spirits, the forest will occasionally goad one or more Forest Dragons to wakefulness in order to counter the threat. More often, the Elves will themselves petition the aid of a Dragon to serve as a steed for a Glade Lord - a request that the beast cedes with reasonable grace, provided it wasn't disturbed from a particularly fascinating dream. Over time, a Glade Lord might form a strong bond with a particular Forest Dragon, the two becoming friends - more than mere allies at need.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_inf_shadow_walkers_0	Bands of Shadow Warriors are often led by the most capable of their kin, known as Shadow-walkers. To reach the rank of Shadow-walker an Elf must have hundreds of years in the field under his cape and have proven to be utterly dedicated to Nagarythe’s cause. Compared to other High Elves, they are merciless, cold and callous - almost indistinguishable from the Druchii they hunt. They are unquestioningly loyal to their king, and as such, will form Alith Anar’s elite retinue on occasions when he is forced into open battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_inf_bleakswords_0	Dark Elf armies are formed around a core of utterly merciless soldiers, schooled in slaughter by a lifetime of survival amidst the twisted streets of Naggaroth's cities. Most such warriors are conscripted into service, but a few muster willingly, having identified some manner in which the battle will play to their personal advantage. All Dark Elves are arrogant beyond tolerance, but Bleakswords far outstrip even other Naggarothi in this regard. Each believes himself to be the greatest warrior of his age, needless of aid and heedless of danger. Bleakswords forsake the spear and the repeater crossbow, deeming the former a peasant's weapon and the latter a craven armament. Instead, they wield slender duelling blades that flash past an enemy's guard to slit his throat or pierce his heart.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_fell_bats	With a body as long as a grown man, Fell Bats are a fearsome sight. They are darker than midnight and silent as death, even when in full flight. In fact, the only noises that Fell Bat makes on the hunt are horrible gobbling slurps when it sinks its distended mouth into living flesh. In truth, a Fell Bat bears as much resemblance to an ordinary bat as a maddened lion does to a domestic cat. Those who have encountered them, and lived, tell how they hunt with unerring accuracy, swooping down to knock Knights from their saddles or pick off lone warriors unawares. Vampires view Fell Bats much as a Bretonnian Lord might his prized hunting falcons. Precious sweetmeats are offered to Fell Bats from the ramparts of the Vampire's fortress, but to harness an entire flock, a grander sacrifice must be made. A fresh victim, belly-slit and screaming, or a terrified messenger sent to run into the night with his eyes put out is more to their taste. Once they have the scene of gore, they will fall upon the enemy battle line with bloodthirsty intent.	true

Many decades ago, Cylostra was the favourite court singer of Bretonnian royalty, a prima donna of considerable size and temper who never accepted anything less than getting her own way. Cylostra was a passenger on the Lamprey during an important diplomatic voyage to perform for the Phoenix King. The galleon went down in a vicious storm, drowning everyone on board. As the Lamprey sank down beneath the waves, her futile, pitch-perfect notes turned to shrill, gurgled screaming. Those who know the legend of the ‘Siren of the Storm’ flee in terror at the sight of her ghostly, barnacle-strewn galleon, for it is said that when it appears, her songs of death paralyse all unfortunate enough to hear them, right before her Undead crew – the Drowned – appear to drag them down into a watery grave.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_lord	Of all the mortal warriors across the civilisations of the world, Chaos Lords are the most feared, for they are truly like gods amongst men. Clad in baroque armour and rich furs, they tower above even other champions of Chaos, who are but feeble children by comparison. A Chaos Lord's indomitable will is forged in the fires of war, his skills are tempered and honed in the crucible of battle, and his blade is eternally quenched in blood. A Chaos Lord is not only an exceptional fighter but also a merciless conqueror. A great leader and strategist, his sheer force of will binds legions of men and monsters alike to his service. Each Chaos Lord's name is spoken in hushed whispers across the lands of Men, his violent deeds written in the blood of his enemies. His is the voice that condemns whole tribes and nations to death. His gaze terrorises his followers into submission and grovelling obedience. An aura of power surrounds each Chaos Lord, drawing ever more devotees to his banner as his legend grows. When a Lord of Chaos marches to war, the world shakes, for in their hearts, all fear that one day a Lord will come who will grind the armies of the world under his heel, and bring about an age of darkness that will never end.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_orion	Orion is the King of Athel Loren. He is immortal, but his existence is irrevocably tied to the seasons. Thus does he pass willingly into his own funeral pyre each Midwinter, only to be reborn into thunderous life on the first day of Spring. Each year, on the eve of the vernal equinox, the Wild Riders select a young prince who will bear the mantle of Orion for the coming year. This chosen one is led to the Oak of Ages and given over to Ariel's keeping. There, she works the miracle of rebirth, sculpting her lost husband anew from the chosen one's flesh and Kurnous' spirit. On the following morning, the chosen one emerges from the Oak's embrace, a mortal Elf no longer, but reborn as Orion, god-king of Athel Loren.	true

These Dark Riders wore cloaks of black feathers, invoking the raven-headed god Nethu to keep them hidden from the eyes of the enemy. During the civil war, the Dark Riders earned a more sinister reputation. They travelled ahead of Nagarythe's hosts, sowing terror and confusion wherever they rode, burning villages and driving their people into the wilds. In battle, Dark Riders take delight in skirting the enemy flanks to attack war machines and cut lines of supply. They revel in the prospect of running down terror-stricken victims, dragging out every moment of wild panic as long as possible before delivering the final heart-seeking strike.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_inf_witch_elves_0	Witch Elves are the cruellest of all their heartless race, for they live only to serve Khaine's malevolent demands for bloody, agonising sacrifice. Their observances to the Lord of Murder are blood-slicked affairs. Still-beating hearts are ripped from victim's chests and hurled into fires, writhing flesh is daubed with gore-red runes and altars are decorated with the entrails of dying captives. Yet ceremonies are but a part of the Witch Elves' worship - their truest observances take place upon the field of battle. On the eve of war, Witch Elves drink blood laced with poisonous barbs, driving them into a divine frenzy. Whilst in this god-touched state, they give no thought to their own defence, and seek only to hack foes apart in a blood-drenched orgy of slaughter. There is little grace to such an assault, merely a whirling storm of venom-coated blades that slash at the foe with maddened fury. Those enemies unfortunate enough to survive their wounds are rounded up by the Witch Elves at the battle's end. These poor souls are torn apart in wild victory celebrations, their blood offered in libation to the ever-thirsting Lord of Murder.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_savage_orc_big_uns	It isn't just their appearance that is wild, for Savage Orcs drum and chant themselves into a bloodthirsty rage before a battle. While other Greenskins might find their backward customs odd, all agree that Savage Orcs are ferocious fighters. Once engaged in combat, they beat foes enthusiastically with hefty clubs and stone axes, or stab at them with flint-tipped spears. Some Savage Orcs use bows, firing stone-tipped arrows to fell enemies from afar. They are also known to employ a Big Stabba, a two-Orc team carrying a long spear. This, traditionally, has been used for hunting since the lands were full of enormous reptilian beasts. Back then, Savage Orcs like to recall, "Orcs wuz Orcs and beasts wuz big!" Some tribes can boast of a mob of Savage Orc Big 'Uns, the fiercest fighters often marked with the most outlandish warpaint or bearing a larger number of shrunken heads, bangles or other fetishes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_thunderers	Standing in closely packed ranks, Thunderers take aim and then discharge their handguns - unleashing a thunderous fury and a cloud of gun smoke. Although not quite as long-ranged as a crossbow, the sturdy Dwarf handgun packs an even deadlier shot, its bullet fired with such velocity it can tear through armour and better take down more heavily protected foes, such as Chaos Warriors. Being methodical, the Dwarfs continue to load and fire in a disciplined manner, so long as their foes are within range. Even when the enemy advance close, almost right up on top of them, Thunderers will seek to get off one last shot. While the onset of bloodthirsty foes might cause lesser races to rush their aim, the steady coolness of the Dwarfs, not the mention the precision of their weaponry, ensures that every volley is fired with the same lethal accuracy as the last, until the moment the Thunderers take up their axes and meet the foe's charge in the bloody press of close combat.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_hammerers	The most skilled warriors in a Dwarf Hold are the Hammerers. They are individuals from different units, and perhaps even Clans, who have proven themselves in uncountable battles, showing not just great strength and deadly martial prowess, but also steadfast loyalty and a bold and courageous nature. They are formed into a hard-hitting shock unit, a force capable of breaking enemy formations the way a heavy maulhammer crushes shale. Outfitted in heavy, well-polished Dwarf mail, Hammerers wade into combat wielding their great weapons. They swing their hammers in sweeping arcs, hitting their enemies with such vigour that only enchanted or hell-forged armour can withstand the force of their blows. With a cracking and crumping, the whirling hammerheads send up gory debris, as splintered shields, cracked bits of armour and even heads or limbs are thrown into the air by the sheer force of the impact. Dwarf battle lines have been known to cheer at the sight of the great hammers rising and falling around their King's banner, beating out a rhythmic noise that is not unlike the deep-booming industrial sounds made by the vast drop hammers found in the larger Dwarf forges.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_wardancers	Wardancers roam Athel Loren in tightly-knit troupes, treading paths and secret ways that few others know or dare use. Other Wood Elves regard the Wardancers as wild and unpredictable, and not without cause, for they are the servants and worshippers of the Elven Trickster God, Loec. The Wardancers lead the Elves in music and rejoicing, and perform the intricate dance rituals that re-enact the history of Athel Loren, a form of storytelling more important to the Wood Elves than the more conventional method of writing. Wardancers are sublime warriors, made even more deadly through their war dances. For these, the favoured rituals of the Trickster God, no rhythm is called nor are orders issued. Instead, the dancers instinctively enact a pattern of lethal movements, complementing the dances performed by the rest of the troupe. Each Wardancer leaps and pirouettes through the enemy ranks to music only she hears, gracefully evading her opponent's clumsy blows and ending his life with an impossibly swift strike of her own.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_thane_lord	The leaders of a Dwarf throng are its Lord and thanes. These are the most powerful fighters in the army, fell-handed warriors equipped with the finest arms and armour of the Clan's weapon hoard. As a rule, Dwarf Lords and Thanes are a grim sort, for they are leaders of a dour people. Upon their broad shoulders is carried the weight of untold debt - the inherited grudges of a long-suffering and unforgiving race. It is their lot to avenge all wrongdoing to their Clan, Hold or race, not just in the present, but also for all time. Failure to redress an injury from antiquity is particularly galling, an act of disrespect to the much-revered ancestors. While Dwarfs are notably an infantry force, there are a few exceptions among their leaders; some Lords are carried into battle by Shieldbearers - stout warriors who serve their liege by hefting a shield as a fighting platform. This is common amongst Dwarfs of the southern Holds and has been continued elsewhere, notable by King Alrik Ranulfsson of Karak Hirn. In other Clans, especially northern ones, Lords and Thanes prefer to fight atop Oath Stones, rocks upon which runes are struck - listing out the Clan's honour, or perhaps the Lord's lineage or deeds. The stone is a symbol of their homeland, a piece of their Dwarfhold made manifest.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_forest_goblin_spider_bows	The giant spider breed grows large enough to serve as mounts for Forest Goblins, who capture and hand-rear these scuttling nightmares. There are many sub-types of giant spider, such as Tilean Greybacks, Drakwald Mancatchers, and the Scarlet Deathheads of the Great Forest, to name just a few. All are poisonous and have steely, pincer-like mandibles that can punch through platemail to deliver a toxic bite. While not as fast as wolves or horses, these spiders can move at speed through the most dense patches of woods. Forest Goblin Spider Riders have become masters at stalking their prey, nimbly guiding their multi-legged beasts to scuttle across the treetop canopy to get into the ideal position before pouncing. Spider Rider mobs are known to ambush Empire patrols, eradicate Beastmen herds and even attack large monsters that encroach into their territory.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_hellcannon	Part-Daemon, part-war machine, a Hellcannon is a massive construct of metal that growls and shakes with daemonic sentience. In battle, these arcane engines heave crackling blasts of raw energy that soar through the air into their targets, liquefying anything they touch and sending the survivors insane with fear. Hellcannons are guided by a team of corrupt and sadistic Chaos Dwarfs. These malign warsmiths escort and restrain the Hellcannons into battle, for the Daemons bound within hunger for a banquet of flesh. Such is the Hellcannon's bloodlust that it must be chained to the ground to stop it rampaging towards enemy lines. Even these precautions often prove inadequate, as there is little that can stay a Hellcannon's lust for destruction. The Chaos Dwarfs load their charge by brutally shovelling the bodies of their enemies into the Hellcannon's dire-furnace. Flesh runs like wax as the Daemon-machine's hearth feasts on body and bone. Soon, only the souls of its victims are left, harnessed in the Hellcannon's gullet as crackling bolts of energy that are fired towards the enemy in powerful spasms of malice.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_goblin_wolf_spears	Goblin Wolf Riders are dangerously fast, able to outride all other beasts save perhaps the swift steeds of the Elves. Some Wolf Rider mobs use bows to fill their enemies with arrows. They lope into range, unleash a hail of arrows, and then retreat before the foe can respond. Wolf Riders often harass the flanks of oncoming troops, but have also been known to charge into smaller (and more vulnerable) units such as war machines and enemy scouts. Other Wolf Rider mobs are more heavily armoured and these Goblins will dare to lower their spears and attack larger formations, howling as they crash headlong into enemy troops. However, it is often said that the snarling wolves are more formidable foes than the Goblins who ride atop their shaggy backs. More than one Warboss has found out that "dog boyz" are not always reliable, finding Wolf Riders as quick to leave the battlefield as they are to launch an attack.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_cygor	Cygors are distant cousins of Minotaurs but, because they hail from the most tainted of all the realms of the Old World, they have diverged greatly from their kin. They are huge, hideously malformed giants, each possessed of a single eye in the centre of its forehead. Through this eye the Cygor is cursed to see not the material realm that mortals perceive, but the ever-shifting Winds of Chaos as they blow through and around the indistinct, ghostly shapes that populate their world. Assailed by such visions since birth, Cygors are all quite mad. The sheer size and ferocity of a Cygor is terrifying enough to mortals, but those who know of their terrible hunger fear them above all else. To the mage, a Cygor is utterly fearsome, for he knows that of all the warriors on the field of battle it is him alone the Cygor wishes to catch in its gnarled and calloused hands, his flesh it wants to tear apart, and his soul it must devour to slake its unending thirst.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_razorgor_herd	Razorgors are massive cousins of the Tuskgors, mountains of mutated muscle and hair that are deadly in the extreme. As with all Children of Chaos, Razorgors are disfigured by hideous mutations, but they generally have the aspect of a nightmarish, gigantic boar covered in spines, tusks and coarse hair. Though Razorgors are voracious omnivores, they prefer a diet of fresh meat, and Beastmen are their natural prey. Still, such is their appetite and fearsome metabolism that they are able to gobble down a knight in full plate mail and his barded horse in a matter of seconds. It is a widely-held belief by the tribes of the woods that Razorgor have two natural states: a digestive torpor that sets in after they have gorged themselves, and blind, unthinking rage, which is by far the more common of the two. Once every decade or so a particularly powerful Beastlord will manage to harness several Razorgors at once. These are either herded into a loose pack and sent headlong into the enemy ranks, or used individually to pull chariots manned by the largest Bestigors. Regardless of who rides them, Razorgor chariots cannot truly be steered or directed - in fact all too often the crew can do little more than hold on tight as the chariot careens toward the foe. Razorgors have beady eyes and poor vision, but when they catch sight of the enemy they are nigh-on uncontrollable. A charging Razorgor can flatten a tree or smash through a chapel wall when roused, so the mess that one of these snorting monstrosities at full charge can make of even the stoutest shieldwall is truly sickening.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_malagor_the_dark_omen	The Beastmen believe that Malagor is the doom of mankind personified. He is a figure of nightmare across the entire Great Forest, revered by the Beastmen but feared above all by superstitious humans. To man, Malagor represents the downfall of all they hold dear. Vilified by the Cult of Sigmar as the epitome of sin due to his many blasphemies, a sighting of Malagor is the most terrifying portent of all. He is the winged fiend that rises from the benighted forests to challenge the gods of men. He is the devil rendered in woodcut in ancient tomes, kept under lock and key lest the terrible secrets within blast the sanity of any who read them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_norscan_ice_trolls	Ice Trolls originate further north than their counterparts from Troll Country. All Trolls have indiscriminate appetites and unthinking ferocity, and the northern variety are no different. With their great strength and regenerative abilities, the warlike Northmen find uses for Trolls in battle, despite them having rather limited intelligence. Most varieties are able to spew acidic stomach bile over their victims to inflict a nasty death, but the Ice Trolls’ proximity to the Chaos Wastes has caused this ability to mutate into something else altogether. With a single exhalation of their icy breath, they can instantly freeze their foes in their tracks, usually just before gobbling them up in a crunch of icy flesh and bones.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_hexwraiths	The origins of the Hexwraiths are shrouded in mystery, but it is said that they are created on Hexensnacht, tearing their way into the mortal realm from the very bowels of the underworld. Their single-minded purpose seems to be the pursuit of those evil men who have cheated their rightful fate, for a Hexwraith's shade-like existence leaves it with a hunger that only the succour of a damned soul can sate. Once the curse of the Hexwraiths has been laid upon their prey, there can be no escape - the spectral horsemen can hurtle across rivers and pass through mountainsides on their incorporeal steeds without slowing their headlong charge. In recent years, the Vampires of Sylvania have learned to bind these creatures of shadow to their service, using them as weapons of war. The sight of a pack of cackling Hexwraiths approaching fast, spirit scythes held high and unnatural soul-fires flickering from their eye sockets, is enough to chill the blood of even the most seasoned warrior. It is small wonder that these deathly riders are amongst the most feared of all the minions of the Vampire Counts.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_waystalker	Waystalkers' personalities have become entirely submerged by their obsession with stalking prey. They are taciturn and solitary individuals, and they may let years pass between visits to the Wood Elf halls. Waystalkers are perfectly at ease within their forest homeland and effortlessly survive by their wits and cunning in the wilds. On the rare occasion when a Waystalker returns to the halls, he stands apart from all others, for he is closer to the forest than to other Elves. A Waystalker's marksmanship shames even that of other Waywatchers. He can pick out a single enemy from a seething mass of troops and place the one perfect shot that brings the target, lifeless, to the ground. Yet the Waystalker finds no reason to exult in the application of his skills - after all, what prey could hope to escape one who has dedicated his entire life to the hunter's art?	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_gyrocopter	Gyrocopters are flying machines whose rotor blades are propelled by an ingenious lightweight steam engine. They can take off and land vertically, as well as hover in position over a spot. Although originally used to fly over difficult mountain terrain and drop supplies and messages to beleaguered settlements besieged by foes, the Gyrocopter was soon tested over battlefields with great success. The main armament of a Gyrocopter is a steam gun. When the valve is released, this unleashes a super-hot steam from the engine that blasts out of the barrel with a hissing scream. Although its reach is short-ranged, a skilled pilot can bob and spin into perfect position to unleash this cloud of scalding death across the foe's ranks. Over the years, the Gyrocopter's firepower has been augmented with bombs, with varying degrees of success. Originally, the pilot was responsible for lighting the fuse and throwing the bomb overboard while trying to fly and dodge enemy arrows. More recently, the Gyrocopter's small payload of bombs has been fitted into the craft's stabilisers.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_belegar_ironhammer	It is a bitter legacy of hatred and resentment that Belegar Ironhammer has inherited. For he is leader of the Angrund Clan and direct descendant of King Lunn, the last Dwarf to rule Karak Eight Peaks before its fall. While the grand mansion of their people - a Hold second only to Karaz-a-Karak in terms of wealth and prestige - was being despoiled, the scions of the former King laboured elsewhere, shorn of home and honour. Many of the ruling heirs of Angrund have attempted to reclaim their former glory, to avenge the grudges bequeathed to them. Despite the weight of years and the hopelessness of the cause, when Belegar came of age he made bold oaths and set out to recover his full inheritance. Belegar has since established himself as a master of subterranean warfare. On his orders enemy probes are smashed, ambushes overcome and infiltration paths blockaded. Yet Belegar is not content to sit behind his fortifications, and many times he has led assaults into the Underhalls of his forefathers. There, from the shattered remains of his Ancestors' tombs, Belegar claimed the rune-struck chunk of rock that now serves as his Oath Stone. It is said amongst Dwarfs that his warrior skills are second only to those of the Slayer King, and that at will Belegar can summon the vengeful powers of his Ancestors. Yet for all his victories, he remains embittered, vowing to one day reclaim all of Karak Eight Peaks for his own.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_fimir_balefiend	A millennia ago, amphibious humanoids known as the Fimir were favoured by the Chaos Gods. Then, as the Gods turned their attentions to the more vibrant and amusing race of man, the Fimir were abandoned. Having since existed in reclusion, they now have a common cause with the Norscan tribes, doing the bidding of the Ruinous Powers as way of regaining their favour. Their mysterious Balefiends wield a powerful magic that appears crude and ritualistic to outsiders, but is incredibly potent. They spend prolonged periods away from the swamps, harvesting power from daemons to destabilise the barrier between the mortal world and the Realm of Chaos.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_inf_skeleton_archers	The Skeleton Archers of Nehekhara nock and loose volleys of arrows as they advance towards their foe without ever breaking stride. Raising their bows as one, the archers fire, reaching into quivers for another arrow before the first salvo has even reached the zenith of its trajectory. These Undead archers unleash great clouds of death that darken the sky moments before falling amidst the ranks of the enemy. Riders are pitched from mounts, and swathes of enemy infantry fall dead as bronze-tipped arrows rain down upon them and pierce their bodies. Skeleton Archers are unencumbered by the large, heavy shields of the Tomb King's other legions, allowing them the freedom needed to fire their long, curved bows. This leaves them with little protection against the swords and axes of their enemies, but any foe wishing them harm must first cross the killing ground, weathering a hailstorm of lethal arrows every step of the way. Only the most heavily armoured of foes can withstand such withering salvos. Less protected targets may instead turn and flee from the onslaught, but once an enemy has entered the sights of a Skeleton Archer, the Undead will not stop until their foes have been killed.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_inf_dreadspears_0	Dark Elf armies are formed around a core of utterly merciless soldiers, schooled in slaughter by a lifetime of survival amidst the twisted streets of Naggaroth's cities. Most such warriors are conscripted into service, but a few muster willingly, having identified some manner in which the battle will play to their personal advantage. Dreadspears consider themselves to be true soldiers, and look down upon the Bleakswords as brash adventurers unsuited to the proper business of battle. Through blood spilt and shed, they have learnt the strength of discipline, of the locked shieldwall bristling with wicked spearpoints. Dreadspear regiments are therefore the reliable bastions around which a Dreadlord can form his battleplan. Whilst the army's wilder warriors roam freely to slaughter at will, the Dreadspears hold key positions and repel counter-attacks.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_big_uns	In many tribes the largest Orcs band together into a mob that is accurately, if not imaginatively, called the "Big 'Uns". These warriors are bigger, stronger and even fightier than regular Orc Boyz. Those that survive their stint with the Big 'Uns often go on to become Bosses, Big Bosses, or even Warbosses. In the meantime, they form an elite unit that quickly gains the reputation of being the hardest-hitting mob in the tribe - a claim they are only too eager to show off to any foes or rivals that get in their way. Only one mob can "be da best", so Big 'Uns are mercifully rare in each Greenskin tribe!	true

Their incredible longevity, as with almost all things supernatural, is the work of the Chaos Gods. Aeons ago, the elders of their race made a pact with the Ruinous Powers, embracing damnation in order to save themselves from a slow decline into extinction. They were given eternal life, and in return, the entire Dragon Ogre race put themselves at the command of the Dark Gods. Since that day, the Dragon Ogres have carved their names across the ages as immortals who can only die in battle, monstrous beings that rouse themselves only in the name of destruction.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_pro02_unit_long_text_vmp_isabella_von_carstein	As the daughter of the last Count von Drak, Isabella carries in her veins true nobility, laced with supreme arrogance and cruelty. Though her union with Vlad von Carstein was at first a marriage of convenience, love soon blossomed - a love that was to see Isabella ushered into the ranks of the Midnight Aristocracy, granting them both the power to realise their dreams. Isabella's newfound ability to raise the dead, coupled with her undying devotion to her husband, means the von Carsteins are more than a match for their enemies. With the Chalice of Bathori in hand, and Vlad at her side, there are few in the Old World who can stand against Isabella von Carstein!	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_runesmith	Runesmiths work spells with their hammercraft, binding the Winds of Magic into mighty runes of power. They are a suspicious lot and jealously protect the secrets kept in their anvils and hammers, guarding the knowledge that allows them to make magic items - weapon, armour, rings and talismans - of greater potency than items wrought by any other mortal race. In battle, Runesmiths aid their side by dampening enemy magic - earthing spells harmlessly before they can wreak havoc amongst the Dwarfs. They do this in the same manner as they capture the Winds of Magic to forge magic items, and they often bring along rune-covered talismans to aid in this endeavour. Many Runesmiths bear weapons and armour of their own crafting, and  they are eager to show their comrades exactly how effective they can be. Whether by some gift of Grungni, or perhaps as a side effect of centuries of beating white-hot metal, when a Runesmith feels the rage of battle, his weapons, and those of friendly foes around him, begin to glow and radiate heat as if remembering the forgefires from which they were created. This aura of power has proven effective in helping blades penetrate the armoured or toughened hides of any foe.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_gorebeast_chariot	Gorebeast Chariots are even heavier and sturdier than other Chaos Chariots. No normal beast would have the strength to pull such a massive instrument of war, and they are therefore pulled into battle by a Gorebeast - a muscular creature renowned for its violent temperament. These grunting brutes strike their prey with such shocking force that those not impaled upon jutting armour spikes are torn apart by the impact. Even the lowliest of beasts recognise the bulky shape of a Gorebeast as synonymous with death. Each iron-clad chariot drawn by one of these formidable mutants is thus followed, at some distance, by circling carrion crows and slinking scavenger hounds waiting to feast on the bloody remnants of a Gorebeast's Grim harvest.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_emp_free_company_militia	Whilst state troops form the mainstay of the Empire’s military forces, its armies are often bulked out by ad hoc regiments of militia who are recruited, willingly or not, to fight as and when required. No one can foretell how many will turn up at the muster, or what their fighting quality will be. After all, these irregular troops receive no formal training or discipline. Many militias are formed of townsfolk and villagers levied from the local countryside – brave men standing ready to defend their homes and families against the monsters and beasts that constantly threaten them. Other militias are bands of mercenaries, bandits or other curs used to living by the strength of their sword arm, hired or pressed into service.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_pistoliers	Pistoliers are young nobles who are not yet old or experienced enough to test their spurs in battle or join one of the Knightly Orders. However, the clarion Call-to-Arms pounds strongly in the veins of these youths, and many cannot wait to march to war and prove themselves on the glorious field of combat. Some spirited young nobles may gather their friends and form regiments of Pistoliers of their own, but most join the ranks of the Pistolkorps, a military organisation funded by the Emperor, the Engineers' School and sponsored by several Knightly Orders. Here, the nobles learn about horsemanship and war from the Outrider - grizzled veterans paid by the Knights to train their sons. Most of the young men who survive their time in the Pistolkorps go on to join a Knightly Order and put the skills and scars they have earned to good use as a fully armoured Knight.	true

It is they who typically oversee patrols, major construction projects and the messenger system. They are aggressive by Skink standards, sometimes riding to battle atop Terradons. It is not their role to sacrifice themselves in battle, however, but rather to spy out intruders, alert the Saurus and then guide them towards the foe.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_noctilus	The infamous admiral known as Count Noctilus is leader of the Dreadfleet – a malevolent gathering of Undead warship captains who bring ruin and damnation to living seafarers. As a former member of Sylvania’s aristocratic dynasty of Vampire Counts, he once went by the name Nyklaus von Carstein but had a markedly different vision from his squabbling peers of how he would achieve necromantic supremacy. After studying the countless charts which map the ebb and flow of magic across the world, he realised that by mastering the art of seafaring he would be able to harness the magical gales that whirl and cascade across the oceans. This newfound route to power eventually led him to translocate himself and his Undead minions to the bone-choked morass of the Galleon’s Graveyard, a fell, sea-based realm of the Unliving between the tangible and intangible worlds which entraps the shipwrecked vessels of the world’s seas. It was in this mysterious place that Nyklaus von Carstein founded his darkling empire and renamed himself Count Noctilus.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_sartosa_free_company	The 'Decadent Pirate Principality of Sartosa', known more politely by its swashbuckling inhabitants as the 'Free City of Sartosa' or simply the 'City of Pirates', is an anarchic pirate island-stronghold located on the southern reaches of war-torn Tilea, off the coast of the Tilean city-state of Luccini. A notorious haven for criminals, it harbours all manner of pirates, brigands, lawless mercenaries - anyone wanting to avoid the various legitimate powers of the Old World. It is a tremendously dangerous place, where drunken pirates press-gang unsuspecting individuals, brawls and duels are an hourly occurrence, and thieves ply the dirty, crowded docks looking for easy marks. Despite the risks, however, it is a place where someone with the toughness and willpower to survive can not only live but thrive, far from the yoke of unfair taxes, overbearing noblemen, and stringent laws. From Sartosa to Araby in the south, the Border Princes to the east, and the mainland past the Great Ocean, exotic lands await. In short, Sartosa is a perfect place for finding fame, plunder and endless adventure!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_goblin_great_shaman	A Goblin Shaman's spells are weedy and irritating, but dangerous - just like Goblins themselves. While Orc Shamans tend to be seen as trance-addled buffoons, Goblin Shamans are cagey and cunning, if no less odd. They often use their magic to barter for tribal influence. Many Goblin Shamans work their way into a top position, either directly advising the Warboss or even taking the command role themselves. Any Greenskin that opposes a Goblin Shaman is apt to suffer nasty rashes, mysterious beetle infestations or some other wicked malady. In battle, Goblin Shamans turn their spiteful spells towards slaying, or at least annoying, the foe. These spells are more subtle than their larger kin's, but no less effective. When an enemy fails to charge because they have doubled up with itchy hives, or the weapons of the Greenskins seem to dart unerringly for weak spots in a foe's armour, it is often due to the magic of a Goblin Shaman.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_slann_mage_priest_heavens_0	The favoured servants of the Old Ones, the Slann have considerable intellect and magical abilities, and rule the Lizardmen as venerated Mage-Priests. Although not physically menacing - their bodies are toad-like with large heads and bulbous eyes - with a flick of their multi-jointed fingers, Slann can topple cities, engulf foes in flames or open vast rents in the ground below. Enemy Wizards find even the mightiest incantation they try to employ unravelling before them as the Slann contemptuously waves its hand. The Slann see the world differently from other beings. Their orderly minds are constantly at work - deciphering complex problems and wandering the cosmos. They sit unmoving on their stone palanquins or in their Star Chambers, and to an outsider a Slann might appear asleep, or even dead. So deeply do they meditate that signs of life are hard to detect - their breaths are shallow and far apart, their eyes unblinking and vacant. Yet the Slann are attuned to more than mortals realise - for they can perceive the magic and raw disorder that has hung in the very air since the great influx of Chaos.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cav_cold_one_spearriders_blessed_0	Saurus warriors are formidable fighters, but when mounted atop a Cold One they become a shock force capable of delivering an absolute mauling. Those foes who can muster the courage to stand before the sight of oncoming Cold One cavalry find themselves beset by a whirlwind of biting jaws, slashing talons and jabbing spear thrusts. Those Saurus Warriors blessed by Itzl have an innate aptitude for mounted warfare. They exude a musk not dissimilar to the rank odour produced by the Cold Ones themselves, allowing them to form bonds with the otherwise hostile creatures. The Saurus have dewclaws that are perfect for gripping the thick-scaled hides of their reptilian steed, leaving them free to carry both spears and shields. All such spawning produce a Pack Leader who instinctively leads the group - knowing where to find the Cold Ones and how best to break them in as mounts.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_longbeards	Longbeards have fought in more wars, beaten more enemies and endured greater hardships than any young Dwarf can possibly imagine. They constantly grumble about how today's Goblins are far smaller and weedier than they used to be and how nothing is as well made as it was in their day. No young Dwarf, as hot-headed and tempestuous as he might be, would dare gainsay a Longbeard; after all, they have much more experience - and the beard to prove it! A Longbeard unit in a battle line is likened to a reliable anchor bolt or bulwark that stands fast and supports the other formations. Woe betide any beardlings who falter under the Longbeards' stern (if rheumy) eyes, for they will be admonished within inches of their very lives. It might not be easy for other units to hold the battle line within earshot of a unit of Longbeards, yet it is also a great honour that redoubles a Dwarf's stoicism and makes even beardlings eager to prove themselves (or at least not give the Longbeards any further ammunition).	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_art_screaming_skull_catapult	The catapults of a Tomb King's eternal army are akin to the stone throwers of other races, but instead of flinging rocks at the foe, they throw volleys of flaming skulls. The Liche Priests cast terrible curses upon every one of these skulls, enchanting them so that they scream hideously as they are hurled through the air, rising to a deafening crescendo just before they strike their target. Those are the very death screams of the skulls' former owners, the wailing shrieks of those slaughtered on the field of battle and the agonised cries of prisoners captured at the moment of their execution. Many battle-hardened warriors are driven to the edge of insanity by the blood-curdling sound. This horrific ammunition bursts into hellish, ethereal flames when it is launched, and as the skulls arc through the air, they blaze an eerie trail of green-fire behind them. Most of these skulls explode on impact, sending fragments of splintered bone in all directions and engulfing those nearby in a wash of balefire. Others smash into their target with horrifying force, infernal flames spilling out of empty eye sockets as the skulls chew through armour and warm flesh alike.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_green_knight	The Green Knight is a well-known figure of Bretonnian folklore, stories and poems about him being amongst the most popular in the kingdom. A common character in puppet shows and plays performed for peasants and kings like, the Knight is bedecked in strange, ivy-covered armour and intones his famous line "None shall pass!". The traditional nemesis of the valiant Questing Knights of these tales, the Green Knight challenges them to duels so that they might prove their worth to the Lady, and thus sup from the blessed Grail. However, most folk do not realise that these stories are bound in fact; the Green Knight is the sacred protector of Bretonnia, and his spirit-essence is intertwined with the land and the Lady of the Lake herself. He has appeared to many Questing Knights throughout history, who subsequently spoke of the sky clouding over with the darkness of twilight and a green mist seeping from the earth, slowly taking the shape of a figure riding a snorting steed. Then the Green Knight appears, brandishing a glowing blade, his eyes ablaze with fay light!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_stormvermin_1	Stormvermin are the fighting elite of the Skaven Warlord clans.

Most Stormvermin are marked at birth, as their size and darker fur colour is recognisable. As the largest and most aggressive, young Stormvermin-to-be typically outfight the rest of their litter for precious food. If the young warriors are particularly strong, the weakest of their litter actually become the food. Should they survive the traumatic politics and back-stabbing as their litter-pack jockeys for position, the strongest Skaven will be assigned to regiments of Stormvermin and outfitted with the best war gear. Their duties may include forming a retinue or bodyguard for anyone from a minor Chieftain to the mighty ruling Clan Warlord himself, which puts the Stormvermin at the vanguard of the army where they can ensure continued preferential treatment by fighting with ferocity and zeal for their leaders.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_lord_change	A Lord of Change is hideously unpredictable and manipulative. Behind its gaze lies a curious and wreckful mind, deeply intelligent, yet as uncaring of consequence as it is fascinated by it. The Lord of Change is like a child playing upon some gigantic anthill, poking with a stick at its inhabitants and laughing at the hopeless antics of their defence. Nothing pleases him more than to see the world broken and made anew, to redirect the course of a life or even history itself, spilling hope upon the ground while raising the ambition of others up to an unexpected pinnacle of power. As might be expected of a creature born of pure magic and bound to the will of the Master of Sorcery, a Lord of Change is a potent spellcaster. The Winds of Magic obey his every command, allowing him to summon whirling tempests of change and mutation, blast the enemies of Tzeentch with bolts of multi-coloured fire or unravel the mind of an enemy spellcaster from the inside. Sorcery is not the only weapon at the command of a Lord of Change - he is also an erudite tactician, well versed in a thousand ploys and stratagems for any given situation. Accordingly, if a Lord of Change prefers to remain uncommitted in battle it is not through lack of courage or ferocity, but because he likes to direct his forces and better control the flow of the fighting. He instinctively sees the skeins of fate that play over the battlefield, and knows all too well how they can be manipulated.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cav_horned_ones_0	The Horned Ones are an extremely rare, virtually extinct and preternaturally swift subspecies of Cold One, spawned in the same pool and at the same time as those who will ride them into battle. The Horned Ones are very aggressive and territorial, and will tackle virtually any other monster, regardless of its size. They are naturally adapted for fighting duels and have large horns and spiny crests growing out of their heads. Unlike other Cold Ones, Horned Ones are not easily manipulated to change their targets, as they are always enraged by the smell of other creatures invading their territory. A Horned One therefore behaves like a Cold One which has already tasted blood and is eager to fight. The bellowing of the Horned One infects other Cold Ones with the same aggression, steeling them against manipulation as well.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_irondrakes	The bitter underground wars that the Dwarfs fight daily to protect their Holds are evolving, as the Dwarfs' foes come up with diabolical plans to get past Dwarfen defences. Time and again, the Dwarfs' courage and rune-enhanced weapons and armour have turned the tide, yet their foes have learned; when Skaven find the corridor blocked by unmovable Ironbreakers, they call for their own loathsome countermeasures - Warpflame-spewing fire throwers, gas grenades or cobbled-together chopping machines. For their part, Night Goblins turn to mushroom-addled ball and chain-wielding Fanatics, Cave Squigs or Troll mobs. For the Dwarfs' defence, the cost in lives is high. It was the Engineers' Guild that invented the Drakegun, a weapon which fires a blast of alchemical fury - a searing bolt of blazing energy. Short-ranged but incredibly potent, a single volley from a unit bearing drakeguns can halt the onrushing charge of enraged Mangler Squigs. Ironbreakers who show an aptitude with the Drakegun were further trained and formed into new units. When first used, even the Gromril armour of the Ironbreakers struggled to protect against the intense heat generated by the fiery blasts. With the aid of Runesmiths, new armoured suits were developed bearing runes of protection first designed to safeguard those who work in the high temperatures of the massive forges. Now, when confronted by a foe capable of breaking through a wall of Ironbreakers, a new fighting tactic has been developed. Ironbreakers open ranks to allow the Irondrakes to file past. With well-drilled precision and the barking orders of an Ironwarden, the dark is soon illuminated by molten blasts. The stalwart Dwarfs blaze away as attackers fall, their crumpled bodies still smoking with fist-sized holes burned through their flesh. The Irondrakes have proven so effective that their services are pressed into action wherever a throng may fight.	true

These dangerous duties require the Sea Guard to maintain a flexible armoury. The vast majority are well-trained in the use of spear, shield and bow - the better to combine the finest aspects of the spear and archer regiments of other cities and realms. Indeed, it is a point of pride in Lothern that the discipline of their warriors far surpasses that of any found elsewhere in Ulthuan. When the armies of Ulthuan go to war, the Sea Guard play a crucial part, crewing the many warships and acting as the vanguard for the oncoming host.	true

When thrown, the sphere shatters, releasing billowing clouds so lethal that mere skin contact can cause severe pain or even death. Breathing the vapours causes lungs to spontaneously fill with bubbling pus - a horrible and nearly instantaneous death. For this reason, Globadiers wear all manner of elaborate masks, goggles and cumbersome rebreathing apparatus in an effort to protect themselves against accidental gassing. Armour offers no protection against poisoned gas, but this does not stop the Globadiers from wearing arcane body armour underneath their robes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_boris_todbringer	Boris Todbringer is a man of blunt truth and affirmative action, but in the election for Emperor of 2502 he was outplayed by the "foolish young pup" Karl Franz and his allies. Finding himself in the shadow of the Cult of Sigmar and denied the throne, Todbringer raged at the newly-anointed Emperor until the Beastmen raids into the Drakwald reminded him that his sacred duties were more important than mere political squabbles, no matter the cost to his status. Like all Middenheimers and men of Ulric, Boris Todbringer never takes a challenge lightly, and so brought total war to the Beastmen and their leader, Khazrak. The feud between them became the stuff of legend; Boris took one of Khazrak's eyes only to lose one of his own by the Beastlord's hand at a later date. This visceral struggle made Todbringer forget his political rivalry with Altdorf in favour of a worthier cause: fighting evil in the Drakwald – the seemingly impossible task of cleansing the forest of its bestial taint and bringing security to the Empire's borderlands.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_black_orcs	Black Orcs are the biggest, meanest and strongest of all Orcs. They get their name from their dark green or black skin, although the title is just as much derived from their dour demeanour. Black Orcs are grim and singularly focused on war - an occupation they take extremely seriously. It can truly be said that Black Orcs live to fight. In this regard all Black Orcs treat other Greenskins, even the more battle-worthy types, such as Boar Boyz, as little more than frivolous amateurs. This is largely because lesser Orcs, even the hulking Big 'Uns of the Orc tribes, are likely to squabble amongst themselves instead of concentrating on the foe. This lack of discipline is a shortcoming that Black Orcs neither forget nor forgive. The Black Orcs' opinion of Goblins is even worse, seeing them as beneath contempt and not fit to carry spare equipment, much less fight.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_organ_gun	An invention of the Dwarf Engineers' Guild, the four-barrelled Organ Gun is so called because its arrays of barrels resembles the pipes of a musical organ. The Organ Gun's barrels are smaller and lighter than an ordinary cannon's, which means it lacks that extreme range and hitting power, but has the advantage of firing a barrage of shots all at the same time. With a well-placed salvo, and all its barrels firing to maximum effect, an Organ Gun has been known to blow away entire enemy units at a time.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_mon_carnosaur_0	Carnosaurs are large apex predators that have terrorised the darkness of the primordial jungles since the dawn of this world's existence. Considered by many as the ultimate jungle hunter, with some growing nearly two stories tall, these massive reptilian beasts are powerfully built and highly aggressive creatures, with long, muscular hind limbs and a heavy tail that is used to balance their enlarged and powerful skulls. Upon scenting prey, or catching sight of even the slightest amount of movement, Carnosaurs propel themselves with enormous strides, moving with surprising speed for such large beasts. Their shortened forelimbs and sharp claws are ideal for locking hold of prey. They have massive jaws, their gaping mouths filled with dagger-like death. Their bite can hack through huge chunks of flesh on larger prey, and by twisting their thick, serpentine necks, Carnosaurs can simply rip their quarries apart piece by bloody piece. Having tasted blood, a Carnosaur is at its most deadly, for it enters a state of savage bloodlust — biting and tearing at any living creature, sometimes slaughtering its gory way through entire herds of giant reptilian without pause. Such is what they were bred to become, for the primordial jungles of Lustria only spares the strongest and most ferocious of monsters, whilst the weak are simply left to be eaten by those seeking to consume flesh.	true

Rising up from the dusty dunes, rank upon rank of these Skeleton Warriors stand ready to kill once more in the name of their immortal monarchs. Holding curved swords and long spears, ancient forms awake from their deathly slumbers, forming up in vast regiments with a supernatural discipline that few living warriors can hope to match. The mighty armies of Nehekhara, made up of regiment after regiment of valiant soldiers, swore oaths of eternal loyalty before the gods to serve their monarch in life and beyond into death.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_royal_pegasus_knights	Only the richest and most powerful nobles own a Royal pegasus, for they are incredibly rare. Those fortunate enough treat theirs with the greatest respect, almost as if it were a peer. Each Lord has a handful of Knights Errant in his retinue whose responsibility it is to care for this, his prized possession and noblest of steeds. Peasants are never allowed near these beasts, lest their stench or clumsiness causes the pegasus harm - indeed, tales tell of the obsessive Volstall of Quenelles, who executed any peasant that even gazed upon his steed.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_vampire	Vampires are the true masters of Undeath. Despite their curse, Vampires retain all of their devious intelligence, and hence all of their ambition and desire. This makes them very dangerous indeed, for they can continue to grow and learn, spending eternity perfecting their skills and honing their diabolical plans and schemes. A Vampire is ultimately a selfish creature who retains many of the traits and drives she possessed when mortal. Whilst the crudest of their kind exist only to feed, some lust after temporal power and conquest of the living. The Necrarchs strive to attain unparalleled necromantic skills, whereas Lahmnians possess immense wealth beyond the dreams of avarice. The greatest curse of Queen Neferata's legacy is that Vampires cannot live on normal food and drink, but must imbibe fresh blood for sustenance. For the youngest Vampires, this unnatural thirst is very strong. At this stage, they are often rash and easily caught and killed by Witch Hunters and other dedicated enemies of the night. Though most learn how to survive on less and less fresh blood until they need to feed only every few years, some never overcome their primal hunting instincts.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_glade_guard	When Athel Loren goes to war, it is the Glade Guard who form the core of the army. Each Elven household fights together on the battlefield with disparate kinbands, combining to create one or more formal regiments under the command of a lesser Lord or Lady of the realm. The Wood Elf army can only seem haphazard and slightly disorganised to outsiders, for each band of Glade Guard is expected to follow the general's broad instructions but, at the same time, is encouraged to take the initiative when the opportunity presents itself. Such a principle often leads to an overlapping line of battle, with individual Glade Guard kinbands advancing and retreating like blown leaves in a storm, all the while pouring volleys of arrows into the foe.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_great_eagle	There has always been a great bond of kinship between the Elves and the Great Eagles, stretching back to ancient times. That bond remains strong between the Wood Elves and the noble avians, and so many families of eagles choose to make their homes in the heights of the Grey Mountains, close by the borders of Athel Loren. On rare or desperate occasions, a Great Eagle may offer itself as a mount to a particularly trusted Glade Lord. This is a great honour in the eyes of the Wood Elves, for it is a true partnership of equals. Such a union forms the start of a great and enduring friendship that continues to bind both parties, even after death.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_minotaur	Minotaurs are massive bull-headed monstrosities that constantly hunger for hot blood and red meat. Often growing to twice the height of a man and far greater in muscular bulk, their thick-skulled heads are broad and ugly, and their horns can eviscerate with a single thrust. Many have the cloven-hoofed hindquarters of a beast and other deformities of the body that the touch of Chaos brings. Though less intelligent than Beastmen, they are unnaturally strong and powerful, and make formidable warriors. To the Minotaurs, the battlefield is a place of maddening excess. The scent of gore in their flaring nostrils drives them wild and they bellow their hunger for all to hear. They charge with a thundering impact, horns lowered to impale, then strike blow after blow against their hapless enemy. Once their victims have been hacked apart, the Minotaurs slake their thirst by tearing at the raw flesh with their gore-encrusted nails and gulping down great hunks of steaming meat whilst the battle rages on around them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_warriors	Chaos Warriors are fighters of unmatched prowess. Their strength is infernal and their bodies are as tough as the Iron Mountains. Imbued with the power of Chaos and encased in suits of hell-forged armour, a Chaos Warrior is equal to several battle-hardened mortal men. They are no longer truly human, but living weapons, honed perfectly for the bloody tasks before them. A Chaos Warrior has no need of food, drink or sleep, for he is nourished by the carnage that he wreaks. He has nothing but contempt for the weak or the cowardly and goes about the business of murder with a vengeance, for there is always a part of the man who was that rages against that which he has become. A Chaos Warrior's only solace is in slaughter - the fulfilment of his new existence as an instrument of his blasphemous God's will, and at battle's end, his armour is spattered with the lifeblood of the slain.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_ungor_spearmen	Ungors (meaning 'no-horns' in the Beastmen tongue) are not as strong or robust of frame as the Gors, but they more than make up for it in sheer malevolence. They are physically smaller than other Beastmen and their horns, if they have any, are less impressive and numerous. While Gors may have long and spectacular horns as deadly as any sword, Ungors usually have short prongs or horn buds sprouting from their skulls, not recognisable as those of a goat or any other type of beast acknowledged by the Gors. Due to this, they are not considered to be 'proper' Beastmen. The race of men, on the other hand, does not draw such distinctions. To them the Ungors are just as horrible, horns or no, for they are twisted aberrations of nature that live to murder and despoil all that is good and wholesome. Ungors are considerably more dextrous than their fellows, their sinewy hands able to carve runes, build wooden structures, and fix and bind the weaponry of their clumsier Gor brethren. So it is that Ungors fulfil a vital role in the society of the tribe, for without them, the herd would soon be bereft of weaponry. Most Ungors take to the field in large herds, arming themselves with stout spears with which to impale their prey and carrying crude shields to protect their grotesque pot-bellied bodies. In battle, Ungors are bullied into a semblance of order by the largest of their number, known as Halfhorns, who seeks a position in the battle line from which they can inflict the most pain and suffering upon the foe.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauders	Marauders are natural fighters, born into hardship and brought up in a world where surviving each day is no small victory. Only the strong and capable prosper, for the weak are weeded out and killed. They have no time for plough or sickle, for their tools are the axe, the sword and the shield. What their own lands cannot provide, they simply take from the lands of lesser men. The Chieftains that lead these warriors are a daunting sight, brooding hulks of muscle and hair whose bodies are covered in the scars and trophies of battle. Bearing weapons worn from dealing a thousand mortal injuries to those foolish enough to face them, these savage leaders are independent and fierce. These battle-hardened killers are the products of a people so steeped in conflict that, even in times of prosperity, they will fight to the death for the honour of leading the next raid. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_night_goblins	Night Goblins are well suited to their subterranean existence. They range in size, but many are on the stunted side, which better enables the spiteful creatures to move quickly through the tight cavernways below ground. Night Goblins are easily marked out from other Greenskins as they wear long, dark, hooded cloaks, in part to blend in with the poorly lit tunnels but mostly to protect themselves from the hated sunlight should they venture above ground. Given a choice, Night Goblins only leave their underground lairs at night or when the sun is shrouded by cloud or gloomspell. When they do emerge, Night Goblins launch deadly raids, ambush travellers in mountain passes, and commit countless other malicious deeds. They are particular enemies of the Dwarfs, and the two races share a long history of bitter battles on mountainous peaks and below ground.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_kroq_gar_0	Kroq-Gar, known as the Last Defender of Xhotl is an ancient Saurus Oldblood, the last of the remaining Saurus warriors from the now ruined temple-city of Xhotl. The spawning that brought Kroq-Gar into the world produced a handful of other Saurus, each marked for greatness. In the instinctive ways of battle-cunning these warriors were unsurpassed by any of their kind, and each possessed an innate dominion over the native beasts of the jungle. Kroq-Gar’s spawning coincided with the rearing of a brood of mighty Carnosaurs, and he claimed the largest and most ferocious as his own. Following the Great Catastrophe, it was none other than the great Lord Mazdamundi, High Slann Mage-Priest of Hexoatl, that summoned Kroq-Gar to his temple-city, choosing him to lead the great Saurus armies that remained. Mazdamundi gifted Kroq-Gar with the ancient artefact known as the Hand of Gods, with which he could sear the flesh from his enemies’ bones. Since that day, Mazdamundi has assigned Kroq-Gar the sacred task of exterminating those creatures not part of the Old Ones’ Great Plan. Over his long existence, Kroq-Gar has fought many wars — leading the armies of Hexoatl, or joining other hosts to aid them in battle.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_plague_monk_censer_bearer	Only the most insanely devoted of the Plague Monks are given the honour of wielding a plague censer - the deadliest weapon in the Clan Pestilens armoury. A plague censer is a hollow spiked metal ball attached to a length of chain. In an unholy ritual, a Plague Priest reads aloud disturbing and disease-ridden passages from the Book of Woe while a shard of Warpstone is placed inside the cruelly-spiked globe. A ladle's worth of vile contagions is added, poured over the Warpstone itself. Hellish runes glow as the devil's concoction immediately begins a slow bubble, sending tendrils of greenish vapours wafting out from the many holes in the ornate iron orb. Contact with the haze of noxious fumes emitted from a gently swaying censer will cause flesh to erupt into sores and fluid-filled blisters. When swung in the heat of battle, however, the censer emits vast billowing green clouds. Exposure to this plague fog causes horrific damage as lungs instantly fill with virulent fluid and vital organs putrefy. It would take a creature absolutely devoid of common sense to be anywhere near such a weapon, much less wield it in battle. Enter the Plague Monk Censer Bearers...	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_cha_grey_seer_plague_1	The Grey Seers are also known as the Chosen of the Great Horned One, prophets of the Lord of the Great Below, and the voice of the Horned Rat. They are powerful sorcerers, capable of channelling eldritch energies in destructive ways, levelling enemy armies with lightning, or summoning ravening swarms of rats. Some Grey Seers ride atop the nightmarish Screaming Bell to unleash untold ruination. More important than their ability to dominate a battle, however, is their role as emissaries for the Council of Thirteen, a position which often grants them the top-rank. Having the backing of a Grey Seer means a clan is in ascendancy, and will gain supremacy in dealings with others. They may barter with the upper hand and a Skaven with an advantage will press it mercilessly. It is always best to exploit such an advantage while it lasts, for it will only be a matter of time before the Seers call with their own demands. In Skaven society it is well known that absolutely nothing comes without a steep reciprocal price.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_grail_reliquae	Many bands of pilgrims cart around a Grail Reliquae wherever they go, the corpse of a departed Knight resting at its centre. A Reliquae's exterior is a gaudy melange, adorned with trinkets gathered from many Grail Knights from across all corners of the realm. The pilgrims devote themselves to this makeshift, portable shrine, supplicating themselves before it as if it were a living Grail Knight, praying for its blessing. To pilgrims, the Reliquae is the ultimate icon of their devotion to both the Lady of the Lake and her Knights, from which the chosen amongst them can preach their creed. There is never a shortage of listeners for these demagogues either, for at each town or village the common people flock to the Reliquae so that they might hear, in graphic detail, the latest tales and deeds of the heroic Knight who unintentionally leads the procession.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_cairn_wraiths	Cairn Wraiths are hooded, spectral creatures that dwell in the realms of nightmare, haunting the dreams of men. They are amongst the most dreaded of all Undead. Lacking physical forms altogether, they cannot be out down by axe, sword or hammer blow. Even the strongest faith cannot banish such creatures easily. Worse still, the icy touch of a Cairn Wraith drains the essence of mortal men. A Cairn Wraith is capable of reaching into the body of an adversary and closing its freezing claws around the victim's vital organs, sending painful chills right through a man's soul. Because they are impervious to physical weaponry, only the raw energies of magic or a well-placed blow from an enchanted weapon can slay a Cairn Wraith. The crippling fear that arises from having a night-unkillable spectre scythe down any too slow to escape causes even brave men to quit the field. Those who do resist the urge to flee find their return blows passing through the Wraith's incorporeal form. It is well that such creatures are so rare, for these silent assassins are quite capable of slaughtering their way through an entire garrison over the course of a single moonless night.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_chariot	Chaos Chariots are drawn by a pair of huge destriers swollen to unnatural size by the corrupting energies of Chaos. Each of these beasts is clad in tempered steel plates in the manner of their unholy masters. As these deadly creatures gain momentum, balefire flickers from their eyes and nostrils, giving the impression that the chariot has galloped straight from the realm of nightmares into reality. When a Chaos Chariot slams into the enemy lines, the bone-splintering impact is only the start of the carnage it can wreak. As the enemy is hurled in all directions by the sheer force of the chariot's charge, the hellish steeds plough through the enemy ranks, iron-shod hooves trampling bodies, and fanged maws snapping at exposed flesh. Spinning scythes slice apart the legs of those who attempt to flank the chariot, and the barbs and spikes that cover its chassis rip and tear at any foolhardily enough to stand their ground. But the chariot's cargo is just as deadly: the charioteers stab and slash from their fighting platform, maiming and decapitating those nearby with their cruel blades and spiked whips.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_balthasar_gelt	Balthasar Gelt's research into new formulations of black powder even made him popular with the Imperial Engineers School, an organisation that often dismisses magic as superstitious nonsense. However, during these studies, a freak explosion almost ended Balthasar's quest for knowledge forever. Somehow he survived, and from that day on has only ever been seen swathed in shimmering, metallic robes and wearing a golden face mask. Some say that beneath his mask his skin has turned pure gold, while others whisper that he is horribly disfigured, though the truth of the matter is known only to Balthasar. One thing is certain: the accident only furthered his will to succeed, and this determination increased his power to new heights. After defeating Thyrus Gormann of the Bright Order in a ritual magic duel, Balthasar became Supreme Patriarch of the Colleges of Magic, replacing the long-standing prominence of Fire with that of Metal.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cav_terradon_riders_0	Terradons are large flying reptiles that have haunted the skies above Lustria since time immemorial. They are dangerous predators with sharp talons and pointed beaks that are filled with needle-like teeth. Many creatures fear to see the ominous shadow of their wide wingspan or to hear the shrill and piercing cries of their hunting packs. Skinks have mastered the art of riding Terradons by capturing their hatchlings at a young enough age that the beasts bond with their future riders - no easy matter considering the height and precariousness of Terradon lairs. There is a great demand for Terradon Riders as messengers and scouts, and they are exceptionally useful in battle. There, they streak ahead of the main Lizardmen force, the Skinks clinging to the flying reptiles' backs, launching poison-tipped javelins or slinging deadly fireleech bolas. Veteran riders, known as Sky Leaders, know to harass larger units, whittling them down to size before flying into combat to finish them off.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_gorebull	Gors form the great mass of the warherds. Their appearance varies, but all combine bestial features with those of a man. The base form of the Beastmen, and that possessed by the vast majority of the Gors, is the head and legs of a goat and the upper torso of a man, albeit a particularly hairy and malodorous one. They have the savage fangs of wolves with which to tear great chunks of flesh from their foes, and muscular and robust (if flea-ridden) bodies well suited to acting out their primal urges. To face a horde of Gors is to face anarchy and mayhem. Rowdy and undisciplined, they bray, bark, and bawl an unceasing cacophony that fills men's hearts with dread. Nonetheless, Gors are capable of taking to the battlefield in more or less ordered formations, a fact that many an enemy general has failed to understand until it is too late. Roving groups of Gors band into tight units that march beneath banners made from the flayed hides of their foes, while others tear the captured flags of defeated enemies, tattered and smeared with blood and dung. The Gors' raucous, bloodthirsty braying is accompanied by the atonal drones of crude pipes and horns in deliberate mockery of the Empire's proud regimental musicians.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_terrorgheist	Amongst the impassably jagged rocks of the world’s most inhospitable ocean shorelines, the flying scourges of the sea known as Death Shriek Terrorgheists make their homes within hidden caves. Like their Sylvanian equivalents, they are titanic, dragon-sized bats that can only be controlled by Necromantic means once killed, which is no easy feat to begin with. All Terrorgheists are ambush hunters, but the marine varieties are set apart from their land-haunting cousins by the difference in their habitat. The lack of land features which would usually facilitate the Terrorgheist’s element of surprise has resulted in it adapting its Death Shriek to be a much more powerful weapon. With a piercing scream that paralyses the passengers and crew of any ship it encounters, it swoops down to gather its prey directly from the decks, scooping them up within its talons before returning to its lair to glut itself on warm blood.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_animated_hulks	An Ogre risen from the dead is amongst the most powerful of minions a Necromancer can control, and a most terrifying abomination to face in battle. The nomadic brutes sometimes take passage aboard ocean-going vessels on their worldly travels, but most are too dim-witted to understand the risk the ocean poses to them, since their dense bellies and hulking frames make them some of the worst swimmers in existence. Whether an Ogre dies by drowning or meets its end by some other means at sea, once its massive, waterlogged corpse spends a prolonged period floating in the briny water it becomes invaluable to seafaring Necromancers. Attributed to the mysterious effects of Galleon’s Graveyard which touches everything that perishes at sea, the reanimation process applied to dead Ogres often yields unpredictable results, sometimes amalgamating their huge bodies with ship parts, or even sprouting limbs and additional heads of hideous sea monsters.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_paladin	Paladins are powerful heroes renowned through Bretonnia for their chivalry and feats of arms. Many of them are high-ranking nobles, holding titles such as earl or baron, while others hold warrior titles like marshal or warden. Paladins are powerful fighters, and make good leaders for units of Knights. Most Paladins are elite Grail Knights, having supped of the Lady's cup and attained everlasting life. Their courage, valour and loyalty are beyond reproach, and they defend the palaces of the Lady to the death. Considered by the people as paragons of society, Paladins attract crowds when they visit, held aloft by all as the very pinnacle of Bretonnian chivalry and brilliance.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_giant	To most Greenskins, a Giant is a bellowing, cursing display of raw might, ruthless aggression and really large stompy feet - all things that make Orcs and Goblins break out into raucous cheering. There are few sights more inspiring than watching one of "da big fellas" stomping an enemy into paste. Some even earn a degree of fame and notoriety, such as "Little Gork", so named because he was once hit in the face by a stone from a Grudge Thrower and has since believed himself to be Gork, painting himself green before each battle for effect. For their part, Giants are happy to join an army of Greenskins, as it significantly increases their chances of eating regularly and getting their hands on strong liquor. Amidst the endless battles, if an odd handful or two of Goblin happens to get scoffed along the way, no one seems to mind - it's just considered part of the rough and tumble of Greenskin life.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_nasty_skulkers	When it comes to discovering underhanded advantages, Goblins are always seeking some new kind of dirty trick, be it a chance to sneak attack a foe or gang up on a crippled enemy. Some Goblins excel at darting forward and stabbing at an enemy's soft spots before slinking away. It is almost magical the way that they seem to pop out of nowhere - striking from between a comrade's legs or leaping out of the shadows "all stabby like". Such devious gobbos are known as Nasty Skulkers and are generally thought to be "a bad piece o' work", even by shifty Goblin standards. Once a Nasty Skulker has latched onto an enemy unit, he will plague it, slitting throats and jabbing groins until he is found out and stomped to death.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc01_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_sorcerer_lord_shadows	Those Champions of Chaos who seek mastery over the magical arts are known as Chaos Sorcerers, and they are madmen and malcontents all. Chaos Sorcerers wield the wild energies of entropy itself, reshaping reality to better serve their whims and those of their dark masters. A word and a gesture from a Chaos Sorcerer can strip a man's flesh from his bones, force a lover to murder his beloved, or cause a regiment of soldiers to burst into flame. They are amongst the most awful and depraved of all servants of Chaos, for they long ago sold their souls in exchange for the heady elixir of pure power. Where many of the world's Wizards, such as those taught by the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, glean their arcane skill from long years of painstaking research, a Chaos Sorcerer's understanding of the Winds of Magic is instant and innate. However, without the patience and wisdom that such study brings, a Chaos Sorcerer lacks due wariness and respect for the ultimate dangers of magic, and so begins an inexorable descent into deformity and madness. Many are the paths that lead to this ultimate fate, but most often, the Chaos Sorcerer seeks to expand his magical powers or harness more of the occult by simply bartering away another fraction of his soul, losing a little more of his humanity in the process. Before long, the aspirant feels his whole body and mind twist and alter, and as the gnawed remnants of his soul are finally devoured, he is plunged into the whirlpools of insanity, leaving behind nothing of the man who was.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_crypt_horrors	Crypt Horrors are only seen openly in times of war, where they are primarily used as the shock troops of ambitious Strigoi Ghoul Kings. Crypt Ghouls are counted amongst the lowliest of all Vampiric servants; after all, they lack even the common decency to be properly dead. So the sight of pack of Crypt Horrors accompanying a Vampire to battle is evidence of the terrible depths that their master has sunk to in his quest for survival. In order to create a Crypt Horror, a Vampire must open his veins to a Ghoul and allow it to gulp down his precious blood - essentially a pale bastardisation of the Dark Kiss - an act that is reviled by those who count themselves amongst the elite of Sylvanian society. In battle, packs of Crypt Horrors muscle their way towards the front lines, eyes glowing with dire light. They used shattered gravestones, tomb statuary and cemetery railings to smash aside those brave enough to stand before them, but it is their meat-encrusted fangs and talons that are to be avoided at all costs. Even a shallow wound from a Crypt Horror bears enough poisonous rot to kill a horse. Despised by the living and the dead alike, Crypt Horrors are creatures to be truly feared.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_mon_stegadon_blessed_1	Stegadons are mighty beasts that have dwelt within the primeval jungles since long before the coming of the Old Ones. They are bulky creatures whose heads are covered by armoured crests, out of which project massive horns. With bony scales and spikes shielding their bodies, there are few predators that dare challenge them. Reared by teams of Skinks who stay with them throughout their lifetimes, Stegadons grow to become very protective of those they have known since they were hatchlings. Large howdahs are attached to the beasts' backs, and from this protected vantage point the Skinks hurl a storm of poison-tipped javelins or fire huge arrows from the mounted great bows known to the Skinks as 'Sotek's Curse'.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_peasant_bowmen	Although they speak their vows of duty, the peasants of Bretonnia do not understand. It is not their business to understand or to think - only to do. They do not know why they are summoned to fight - these things being beyond their regard - yet when the Greenskin hordes are bearing down upon them, low-born men know they must fight or die. Sometimes they are fortunate enough to be armed with rudimentary weapons; bows, with arrows drenched in oil and lit, or dipped in diseased buboes. Unlike Men-At-Arms, Peasant Bowmen are not equipped from the armouries of the castle and so their longbows will often be their own possessions, handed down from father to son and, accordingly, are of variable quality. Peasants who survive a battle may think themselves lucky until they too are stricken by fatal pox, mayhaps from a cut received whilst loading their unfamiliar and cumbersome weapons!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_thorgrim_grudgebearer	Thorgrim Grudgebearer is the current High King of the Dwarfs. He is a throwback to the High Kings of old - eager for new conquests, mighty in battle, and a merciless enemy. Yet upon his worn brow there also sits a great wisdom, and he is able to uphold the ancient traditions as well as to accept (if not embrace) needed changes, such as alliances and new technology. Thorgrim is forever brooding upon how to return his people to their former glory. As the ultimate ruler of the Dwarfs, the Great Book of Grudges is entrusted into his keeping. It is Thorgrim's avowed wish to avenge every single entry contained in that voluminous tome - an impossible task if he should live a thousand lifetimes. Yet such is his resolve that he has already helped to rejuvenate the whole of the Karaz Ankor. Tales of his deeds, and the long list of grudges already struck out, fill his grim warriors with a feeling that the Dwarfs have long done without: hope. Borne upon the Throne of Power and brandishing the Axe of Grimnir, Thorgrim is at the forefront of what the Dwarfs hope will be a great conquering - a new age of retribution!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_mon_heirotitan	A Hierotitan is a gigantic animated statue whose face is carved in the likeness of one of the Nehekharan deities of death. These idols radiate a sinister aura of magic, and it is said that those who stand within their shadow can hear the cruel laughter of ancient gods. Hierotitans were constructed to stand within the uppermost chambers of the Tomb Kings' burial pyramids. It was believed that they would act as spirit guides for the souls of deceased kings, responsible for ushering the eternal spirits of monarchs between the mortal world and the Realm of Souls. No expense was spared in sculpting a Hierotitan, a towering effigy whose form was lavished with gold and gems. In one hand, it carries an elaborate staff, known as the Icon of Ptra, which bears the hieroglyph of the sun god and lights the Hierotitan's path as it walks in the abyss that separates the mortal world from the Realm of Souls. This light wards away the evil spirits that dwell in the dark, Daemons who would otherwise prey on the souls of those wandering the void. The Hierotitan's other hand grasps a giant pair of scales, called the Scales of Usirian.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_pegasus_knights	Most Pegasus Knights hail from around the border city of Parravon, hard on the slopes of the Grey Mountains where many of their noble mounts can be found. Their numbers are made up almost exclusively of Knights of the Realm, and then only the richest and most influential can boast of owning a battle-trained pegasus, for the creatures are difficult to capture and harder still to train. Accordingly, to own such a beast is the ultimate symbol of wealth and success for their owners, but in truth a pegasus is also a great practical boon for any Knight fortunate enough to acquire one. A pegasus is stronger and faster than even the mightiest warhorse, easily able to crush a man’s skull with its flailing hooves and cover great distances swiftly. Indeed, in the more wild and inaccessible domains of Bretonnia, there is real merit to a steed that is not prone to becoming mired in mud or entangled in thorns. On the battlefield, small groups of Pegasus Knights will group together, often outstripping the rest of the army as they search for honourable combat.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_inf_black_ark_corsairs_0	Black Ark Corsairs are notorious reavers, having spent their entire lives pillaging distant lands. They are the lionised darlings of Naggarothi society, embodying as they do the drive to earn riches and glory. It is a hard, dangerous life in the raiding fleets, but a successful voyage can see a captain and crew return laden down with wealth beyond the dreams of most city-dwellers. It is not uncommon for a Corsair fleet to spend years ransacking foreign lands, returning home only when their holds are bursting with slaves and plunder. As they tend to do most of their fighting in the topmasts of ships and the crowded tangle of dockside streets, Black Ark Corsairs prefer fast weapons that give them an edge in one-on-one fights. Cutlasses, punch daggers and barbed knives are common, as are repeater handbows. Corsairs eschew shields and metal armour, relying on cloaks fashioned from Sea Dragon hide to preserve them from injury. They also carry a vile array of nets, grapples and barbed chains. Such tools are not only useful for getting a grip on the slippery flank of a ship, but also for ensnaring fleeing victims, who are soon thereafter dragged to a terrible fate.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_razorgor_chariot	Razorgors are massive cousins of the Tuskgors, mountains of mutated muscle and hair that are deadly in the extreme. As with all Children of Chaos, Razorgors are disfigured by hideous mutations, but they generally have the aspect of a nightmarish, gigantic boar covered in spines, tusks and coarse hair. Though Razorgors are voracious omnivores, they prefer a diet of fresh meat, and Beastmen are their natural prey. Still, such is their appetite and fearsome metabolism that they are able to gobble down a knight in full plate mail and his barded horse in a matter of seconds. It is a widely-held belief by the tribes of the woods that Razorgor have two natural states: a digestive torpor that sets in after they have gorged themselves, and blind, unthinking rage, which is by far the more common of the two. Once every decade or so a particularly powerful Beastlord will manage to harness several Razorgors at once. These are either herded into a loose pack and sent headlong into the enemy ranks, or used individually to pull chariots manned by the largest Bestigors. Regardless of who rides them, Razorgor chariots cannot truly be steered or directed - in fact all too often the crew can do little more than hold on tight as the chariot careens toward the foe. Razorgors have beady eyes and poor vision, but when they catch sight of the enemy they are nigh-on uncontrollable. A charging Razorgor can flatten a tree or smash through a chapel wall when roused, so the mess that one of these snorting monstrosities at full charge can make of even the stoutest shieldwall is truly sickening.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_def_cav_doomfire_warlocks_0	When Malekith first learned of the Prophecy of Demise, his initial wrathful blow fell against the Doomfire Warlocks of Hag Graef. Fearing their rebellion, the Witch King cursed them with hollowness, and their souls have teetered between the mortal world and the Realm of Chaos ever since. Thus, whilst other Elves fear Slaanesh as a potential fate, Doomfire Warlocks feel the Dark Prince's grasp on their souls grow with every passing day. As the grip tightens, dark runes blaze in to life on their flesh, an unholy fire that creeps slowly across the skin.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_sorcerer_metal	Those Champions of Chaos who seek mastery over the magical arts are known as Chaos Sorcerers, and they are madmen and malcontents all. Chaos Sorcerers wield the wild energies of entropy itself, reshaping reality to better serve their whims and those of their dark masters. A word and a gesture from a Chaos Sorcerer can strip a man's flesh from his bones, force a lover to murder his beloved, or cause a regiment of soldiers to burst into flame. They are amongst the most awful and depraved of all servants of Chaos, for they long ago sold their souls in exchange for the heady elixir of pure power. Where many of the world's Wizards, such as those taught by the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, glean their arcane skill from long years of painstaking research, a Chaos Sorcerer's understanding of the Winds of Magic is instant and innate. However, without the patience and wisdom that such study brings, a Chaos Sorcerer lacks due wariness and respect for the ultimate dangers of magic, and so begins an inexorable descent into deformity and madness. Many are the paths that lead to this ultimate fate, but most often, the Chaos Sorcerer seeks to expand his magical powers or harness more of the occult by simply bartering away another fraction of his soul, losing a little more of his humanity in the process. Before long, the aspirant feels his whole body and mind twist and alter, and as the gnawed remnants of his soul are finally devoured, he is plunged into the whirlpools of insanity, leaving behind nothing of the man who was.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_bright_wizard	The Lore of Fire, or Pyromancy, is borne upon the searing Wind of Aqshy - the study of the Bright Order. The Key of Secrets is their symbol, representing the unlocking of knowledge. Fire Wizards are easily recognised for their red robes and wild orange hair and beards. They are ruddy of skin and are frequently adorned with tattoos that writhe with the weaving of their spells. They are of a fiery temperament, their anger capable of changing from a guttering flame to a raging inferno in a split second. The Bright College is a marvel of architecture. Blazing towers rise like pillars of fire into Altdorf's sky. At the heart of the college, a gigantic beacon burns both day and night, and once cast an eerie scarlet glow over neighbouring districts. The college now stands alone, however, surrounded by a blackened wasteland where, according to hearsay, a warren of streets once stood.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_miners	When Dwarfs march to war, many mining Clans form regiments to join the battle. As a point of pride, they do not bear axes, but instead wield the same heavy two-handed mining picks and mattocks they use to laboriously carve out tunnels. As it turns out, these well-balanced and sturdily-made tools work equally well whether digging in to bedrock or hacking apart Goblins. Because tunnelling in the deeps is dangerous work, Miners constantly wear heavy armour and helms. Down the ages, this mail has served to protect them against rockfall and cave-ins as well as turning aside such attacks as Elf arrows or rusty Skaven blades. The longer and more established a Dwarf mine is, the more likely it is to be augmented with mechanical contrivances. Great steam engines draw in fresh air or haul chains to tow wagonloads of rock out of the depths. Some Miners even take to war with a few of their 'gadgets', such as blasting charges or a steam drill to aid in tunnelling under the enemy battle lines quickly. While the most conservative Dwarfs still grumble about these newer generations, stoutly wielding a pick to carve through a foe and winning the battle go a long way to aiding acceptance.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_amber_wizard	The Wizards of the Amber Order use the symbol of the Arrow and are devotees of the Lore of Beasts, which is heard as an eagle's cry upon the Wind of Ghur. Amber Wizards are renowned for their savage appearance; their hair is wild and unkempt and they dress in furs adorned with bones, feathers, amber beads, and primitive talismans. Few wizards can withstand the touch of Amber Magic, for it is the magic of bestial minds and untamed places, caring little for the ways of civilised cultures. The power of the Wind of Ghur resides most strongly in the thoughts of savage creatures and, as a result, Amber Wizards can commune with animals of all kinds. They also have the ability to assume the strength of the greatest beasts and can induce primal states of terror in others.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_archaon	Archaon is the Lord of the End Times, the vessel through which the Dark Gods will unite their followers and turn the whole world into a Realm of Chaos. He is an individual whom all the Chaos Gods have bestowed their gifts upon. Of all the Everchosen of Chaos who have assailed the world over the ages, Archaon is the most ruthless and powerful. At the heart of Archaon's army is his old warband, the Swords of Chaos, the most dread group of Chaos Knights ever to have blighted the world. The Everchosen often rides to war leading this cadre of veterans from atop the daemonic beast known as Dorghar, the Steed of the Apocalypse.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_warrior_priest	The Cult of Sigmar demands that its followers fight all forms of evil with martial feats as well as with faith, so many of its priests accompany the Empire's armies as they march to war. In this role, they not only lead and inspire troops in battle, but also minister to their spiritual well-being. Warrior priests are clad in ceremonial vestments and armour adorned with symbols of holy hammers, twin-tailed comets and other religious icons. They shave their heads as a sign of devotion and they carry all manner of strange fetishes made of iron, wood and bone. Many Warrior Priests further adorn themselves with scrolls detailing war oaths and parchments written in the blood of martyrs.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_azhag	Azhag is a threat like no other. What makes Azhag so unusual is his ominous iron crown, which emanates pure, ancient evil. It is this crown, a relic of olden days, which grants Azhag sorcerous powers and a sinister council beyond the comprehension of any Greenskin. This evil combination of Orcish brute-strength and a brilliant, if completely malevolent, ability to grasp far-seeing strategy makes for a deadly combination.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_gunnery_wight	As most Necromancers know, it is notoriously difficult to get a reanimated minion to use a firearm with any level of effectiveness due to their limited dexterity. Some men are so adept in the use of their weaponry during their lifetimes, however, that the Winds of Magic imprint those skills upon them so they may also manifest after death. The rifle-wielding Gunnery Wights are examples of this phenomenon, carefully animated from the corpses of high-ranking marksmen and artillerymen to be as obsessed with gunpowder in death as they were in life. Most were skilled mercenaries, part of the constant stream of brigands from the Empire, Kislev, and lawless places such the lands of the Border Princes, taking to the oceans in search of riches and adventure.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_questing_knights	Since the days of Giles the Uniter, the Holy Grail has been the ultimate symbol of Bretonnian chivalry, and the ultimate goal of any true Knight has been to find it. He who begins the quest for the Grail relinquishes all his worldly possessions and all ties to his domain. Setting aside his lance, he instates another Knight to fulfil his duties of administration and protection prior to setting out upon the quest. The following months and years of the Questing Knight's life are filled with trials and hardships that strengthen his mind, body and soul. His path is a winding one, for he is pledged to never sleep two nights in the same place and never to yield in his search whilst he continues to draw breath.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_clanrat_spearmen_1_summoned	The bulk of most Skaven armies are formed of Clanrats - a vast and verminous horde of ratmen that make up the warrior class. These Skaven belong to any one of thousands of clans scattered throughout the underground burrows, strongholds, and bursting cavern-cities that make up the Under-Empire. Of all the teeming masses, only the worker dregs, the shiftless Skavenslaves, are more numerous than the Clanrats. When a Warlord gathers his might for war, the Clanrats are front and centre, occupying a key place in the battleline. They form into great blocks to overwhelm a foe with their weight of numbers and the fury of their attack. If the Warlord can afford the price and is in reasonable standing with Clan Skryre, then a Weapon Team might accompany the regiment. These arcane devices of destruction are viewed suspiciously by the Clanrats, who frequently suffer due to their all-too frequent technical failures.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_mon_phoenix_flamespyre	The Phoenixes of Ulthuan dwell amongst the Flamespyres - great alabaster pillars of rock that stand sentinel about the Shrine of Asuryan. These constantly burn with magical flame, for Aqshy - the Wind of Fire - gusts about these rocks as it is drawn inexorably towards the Isle of the Dead. Yet Aqshy has left its mark on more than the silent stones. Over generations, the Phoenixes have become attuned to fire magic, harnessing it at whim. When a Flamespyre Phoenix is enraged, its plumage explodes into a magical flame, causing the creature to leave a trail of angry fire in its wake. Should one be slain, it explodes, leaving naught behind but a shower of flaming cinders. If the Winds of Magic ebb, the creature perishes, as all living beings eventually must. Yet if the air is sufficiently suffused with magic, the fiery fragments swiftly recoalesce; with a booming inrush of air and a flash of searing light, the Phoenix is reborn to fight anew.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_vmp_vlad_von_carstein	Vlad von Carstein was the first and greatest of the Vampire Counts of Sylvania. A master swordsman and skilled general with no small aptitude in the magical arts, it was he who tainted the aristocracy of Sylvania with the curse of vampirism, and in doing so, created an Undead kingdom at the heart of the Empire. Count Vlad was a towering figure, with a mane of long hair and piercing eyes. Those who met him and survived described him as possessed of a "feral charm", but with an evil temper that could turn into a berserk fury if he was thwarted in his endeavours. It is said that at such times, only his wife, Isabella, could calm him without blood being spilled. No records tell of Vlad's origins before his coming to Sylvania. Even the Vampires of that realm know nothing of his life before that fateful night in Drakenhof, and Vlad certainly never recounted or wrote down his personal history. That he knew much about the workings of the Empire, and its internal division at the time of his arrival, attests to knowledge of the dealings of mortal men for many years.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_goblin_spearmen	Goblins gather in great numbers under the tyranny of an Orc leader, or in widely-varying tribes of their own. Regardless of whether a Goblin is a lackey under the heel of a domineering Orc or the member of a distinct tribe, they make for lacklustre troops. However, Goblins can defeat an enemy through sheer weight of numbers, especially if they can attack from a flank or even better from behind. Goblins prefer to attack defenceless foes and shooting arrows from a distance is likewise a popular type of attack among their kind.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_emp_volkmar_the_grim	Volkmar the Grim is the head of the Cult of Sigmar and the most powerful religious leader in the Empire. He is a pious and foreboding man who is utterly devoted to the destruction of Chaos in all its forms. When the Grand Theogonist accompanies an army into battle, he typically rides atop the resplendent War Altar of Sigmar, inspiring the soldiers around him to great acts of heroism as he strikes the followers of Chaos down with powerful blows and words of divine force. Volkmar is a holy terror on the battlefield, a man who fights with the fury of Sigmar himself. It is said that Volkmar's soul was forged of steel and he fights the malign influence of Chaos with every fibre of his being.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauder_hunters	The ruthless martial societies of the northern tribes see many men cast out into the wastes due to some transgression or another against their clan. An unforgiving way of life means that it is often impossible for these men to re-assimilate themselves into the warrior hierarchy. The few exiles that avoid death out in the freezing tundra often come together to form bloodthirsty bands of wild hunters, etching out a brutal existence that makes them even more hardened, callous, and adept as warriors – Marauders with the skill of ambush hunters. Attaining such skills is a way back into the battle ranks: when larger forces of tribesmen come together, the Marauder Hunters’ terrifyingly efficient ambushes frequently mark the beginning of their raids.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_inf_swordmasters_of_hoeth_0	Swordmasters are exemplars of the martial arts. Each has studied warfare and personal combat for decades, or even centuries. It is even said that the highest masters of the order can slay a foe with but a touch, or kill with a single precisely-pitched whistle. When Ulthuan marches to war, none go more eagerly than the Swordmasters of Hoeth, for only in war can they truly unleash the full extent of their deadly art. As they advance, their blades blur and weave, knocking aside arrows in mid-flight and leaving trails of bloody spray wherever Hoeth-forged steel tastes flesh. The Swordmasters' greatswords are forged beneath the Tower of Hoeth, by smiths whose secrets are the envy of even the priests of Vaul. Each elegant blade is as long as an Elf is tall, yet is balanced so perfectly that, to a warrior skilled in its usage, it seems as light as a feather. So keen is the greatsword's edge, and so enduring are the enchantments woven into its blade, that its sharpness is never dulled, no matter how many helms or skulls are cloven by its strikes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauder_chariot	Marauders are natural fighters, born into hardship and brought up in a world where surviving each day is no small victory. When they take to their war chariots, they fight with even more ruthlessness and fervour for the Dark Gods, slamming into enemy lines with bone-shattering speed, hurling enemies in all directions from the sheer force of the impact.  The chariots utilised by the Marauders are similar to those used by the warriors of Chaos, pulled by hellish steeds, with spinning scythes forged to their wheels, and a spike-covered chassis to cause maximum bloodshed in a charge. The weapon of choice for the Marauder charioteers is the mighty halberd, providing ample damage output when the chariot is forced into close-up combat situations.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cav_ellyrian_reavers_1	To this day, Ellyrian Reavers form a deadly part of Ulthuan's armies. They rove the wild lands of Ellyrion, slaying the monstrous beasts that leave the borders of the Annulii and seek to rampage through the Inner Kingdoms. Many a cockatrice or chimera has been laid low by the well-placed arrows or spear thrusts of the noble youths, and many more Dark Elves have had their cruel raids cut short. Indeed, such pride do the Ellyrian Reavers take in their skills that many of the young nobles keep a tally of slain foes. When the sun sets and set fighting ceases, he whose spear has felled the greatest numbers of enemies is granted the honour of carrying the regiment's standard into the next battle. However, he who slays the mightiest opponent receives Kurnous' favour; when next he rides to war he will do so as one of Kurnous' Harbingers, blessed with peerless aim by the wild God of the Hunt.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_knights_errant	All noble sons of the realm are committed to the path of Knighthood from the moment they are born. Though birth into nobility guarantees his place, a young noble is not honoured until he has proven his worth. Some earn status through faithful service to their Lords, others through powerful connections and family ties, but the most glorious and only true way for a young Knight to fulfil his calling is to test himself against the foe on the field of battle. Eager to prove his skill, and thus attain status and renown, a Knight Errant is bold and enthusiastic to the point of recklessness - a trait that common folk idolise and admire. On the battlefield he is impetuous, eager to earn fame and honour in the thick of the fight. He charges boldly into the fray, heedless of danger and desiring glory, even if it means his own death. Older, more experienced Knights rarely discourage this, as it is both a way of pruning the ranks and a suitable outlet for the enthusiasm of youth. None would deny a young Knight his destiny - those whose skill and bravery are proven will go on to become Knights of the Realm.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_minotaur_shields	Minotaurs are massive bull-headed monstrosities that constantly hunger for hot blood and red meat. Often growing to twice the height of a man and far greater in muscular bulk, their thick-skulled heads are broad and ugly, and their horns can eviscerate with a single thrust. Many have the cloven-hoofed hindquarters of a beast and other deformities of the body that the touch of Chaos brings. Though less intelligent than Beastmen, they are unnaturally strong and powerful, and make formidable warriors. To the Minotaurs, the battlefield is a place of maddening excess. The scent of gore in their flaring nostrils drives them wild and they bellow their hunger for all to hear. They charge with a thundering impact, horns lowered to impale, then strike blow after blow against their hapless enemy. Once their victims have been hacked apart, the Minotaurs slake their thirst by tearing at the raw flesh with their gore-encrusted nails and gulping down great hunks of steaming meat whilst the battle rages on around them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_trolls	Trolls live alone or in small groups, and roam desolate regions, preying on travellers and attacking isolated villages. Bands of Trolls often latch onto Greenskin tribes, attracted by the profusion of carcasses and refuse. Some are even thrown the odd Snotling or captive - the Greenskins do this to encourage the Trolls to stick around, for they are handy in a scrap. Trolls can maul any foe, but are so dumb it is hard to get them to follow orders. Savvy Warbosses know that without help the brutes seldom remain focused on the battlefield. Left on their own, Trolls are easily distracted and, instead of attacking, will stoop down to eat the injured or simply stand and drool. Only by barking commands himself, or by tasking a Big Boss to lead the Troll pack, can a Greenskin commander come close to relying on the hulking creatures. Even this shepherding isn't foolproof and some Trolls have been known to tune out a Warboss' yelling in order to eat rocks or pull up offending patches of grass. However, should the creatures reach combat they flail about with their mighty fists or makeshift weapons to lay waste to just about anything. Trolls also have the disturbing ability to retch up the contents of their stomachs. This noxious attack sprays semi-liquid bile and half-digested bits all over its victim, melting through armour and searing away flesh and bone - it is, truly, an ugly way to die.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_ungor_spearmen_shields	Ungors (meaning 'no-horns' in the Beastmen tongue) are not as strong or robust of frame as the Gors, but they more than make up for it in sheer malevolence. They are physically smaller than other Beastmen and their horns, if they have any, are less impressive and numerous. While Gors may have long and spectacular horns as deadly as any sword, Ungors usually have short prongs or horn buds sprouting from their skulls, not recognisable as those of a goat or any other type of beast acknowledged by the Gors. Due to this, they are not considered to be 'proper' Beastmen. The race of men, on the other hand, does not draw such distinctions. To them the Ungors are just as horrible, horns or no, for they are twisted aberrations of nature that live to murder and despoil all that is good and wholesome. Ungors are considerably more dextrous than their fellows, their sinewy hands able to carve runes, build wooden structures, and fix and bind the weaponry of their clumsier Gor brethren. So it is that Ungors fulfil a vital role in the society of the tribe, for without them, the herd would soon be bereft of weaponry. Most Ungors take to the field in large herds, arming themselves with stout spears with which to impale their prey and carrying crude shields to protect their grotesque pot-bellied bodies. In battle, Ungors are bullied into a semblance of order by the largest of their number, known as Halfhorns, who seeks a position in the battle line from which they can inflict the most pain and suffering upon the foe.	true

As a Dragon Ogre ages, it becomes ever larger, growing stronger and more powerful.

The eldest and most primal of their kind are truly titanic beings, each a towering mountain of muscle and fury, reinforced by the power of the raging storm.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_inf_deck_gunners	Clunky, cumbersome, and with bone-shattering recoil, it takes the heftiest of crewmen to operate the mounted swivel guns commonly seen mounted on the decks of warships and pirate ships of the world’s seas. In the field, they are seldom used by the armies of the living, since very few mortals possess the strength and bravery required to carry and use a firearm which for all its destructive advantages, is prone to explosive failure due to imperfect castings or poorly mixed black powder. For the zombies of the Undead pirate hordes, however, the prerequisites of bodily strength and bravery are no hindrance, since the reanimated possess supernatural motor functions and mindlessly carry out the will of their masters. So it is not uncommon to see Deck Gunners of zombie pirate crews haul their massive volley guns into a land confrontation in two-zombie teams, frenziedly firing directly into crowds of ill-fated victims.	true

The Old Ones cultivated this race of reptilian warriors, although whether they created them entirely, or raised them up from some primordial life form of the jungles, is not clear. What is assured, however, is their role and function. In the prehistory of the world, a time before the coming of Elves or Dwarfs, it was the Saurus who pacified the lands, fighting great battles and exterminating entire species in accordance with the Old Ones' plans. Although unable to master more complicated devices, Saurus use simple weapons to devastating effect - wielding obsidian-tipped spears and heavy clubs spiked with jagged stones. Using their great strength, Saurus can leave the roads and hack through the dense jungles of Lustria using brute force alone.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_cha_queek_headtaker	Warlord Queek Headtaker is Right Claw to Warlord Gnawdwell, grand ruler of Clan Mors and member of the Council of Thirteen. That Queek has risen so high in arguably the most powerful Warlord clan is a credit to the terrible violence he unleashed on any in his way. Queek's vicious streak and vitriolic temper, along with his immense ego, are legendary amongst Skaven, who regard such traits as greatly admirable. Although his scarlet-armoured Stormvermin often accompany him, Warlord Queek takes pleasure in personally dispatching enemy leaders. In his arrogance, he carries the severed heads of his latest opponents on a trophy rack to remind followers - and Warlord Gnawdwell - of the fighting prowess of the almighty Warlord Queek, the Headtaker, the Dwarf-smiter. Adorned upon spikes in Queek's collection are Krug Ironhand, Ikit Slash of Fester Spike, and the hands of Baron Albrecht Kraus of Averland.	true

As Arrer Boyz can prove their prowess in combat, such oddities can be overlooked. Still, it is best not to camp next to Arrer Boyz, as a hail of arrows periodically pincushions passers-by. Yelling rude names at Arrer Boyz is a proven way to alleviate camp boredom and the start of many a good ruckus.

A Skaven does not gradually earn respect or position, and there certainly is no giving in the brutal society of the ratmen. Leadership must be savagely taken. To gain power, a Warlord must seize control, proving himself a top fighter and a devious adversary. Such a coup either ends in failure and certain death at the hands of the existing ruler, or the new leader supplants the current Warlord, often eating him in the process. Challenges follow no format but often take the form of personal combat, treacherous back-stabbing, or elaborate political schemes. The more underhanded the deed, the better, for that is what puts the fear (and what almost passes for respect) into the Skaven masses.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_dryads	Dryads are spiteful creatures with hearts akin to shards of ice. In the soul of a Dryad, there is neither room nor regard for compassion or mercy, merely an uncompromising dedication to Athel Loren that makes even the most heartfelt vows of Elf or Man seem trivial by comparison. To harm the forest is to invoke a deadly and unyielding vengeance that ends only when the transgressor's body has been ruined and broken. Only a fool deliberately offers insult to a Dryad, but alas, these spirit-maids are so utterly different to mortal creatures that offence is often taken whether it was intended or not. Few mortals make such a mistake twice, and then only if the individual in question is either very lucky or very swift. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_grimgor	Even for a Black Orc, Grimgor's thirst for war was exceptional. If a single day went by without a battle, Grimgor was known to start camp-decimating arguments, his one good eye blazing with eagerness to find fault and start a good scrap. Two days without a battle and Grimgor would smite anything he could reach, save (perhaps) his fellow Black Orcs. No one knows for sure what would happen if three days without a battle ever occurred, but even scarred veterans tremble just to think of it. This unquenchable thirst for battle is a sign that marks out a Warboss for leadership, a sign that the Orc is favoured by Gork (or Mork). In a hulking Black Orc with unmatched fighting skills and ferocity it has marked out Grimgor for greatness; the prophet and harbinger of Gork (or Mork).	true

Their magic is orientated around nature more so than most other human Wizards, for they are taught by the handmaidens of the Lady. Riding into battle, Damsels and Prophetesses use their powers to lend magical protection to Bretonnia's noble warriors, warding away the foul magic of their enemies as well as casting them down with powerful spells of their own. They are also able to mystically encourage the landscape to fight the kingdom's enemies; persuading the trees themselves to lash out at the foe; calling flocks of birds to descend on the enemy at their call; even drawing lightning from the heavens to strike down in devastating arcs.	true

So it is with the Red Duke; a warrior of terrifying renown who now wages war across Bretonnia in search of ever-greater power. He is an Undead scourge upon the kingdom, but it was not always so. He was once the Duke of Aquitaine, a mighty warrior who quested determinedly in the Lady’s name. However, he was struck down by mysterious illness that claimed his body and ravaged his soul. He was interred by his Knights in a grand tomb worthy of his successes, yet he rose again three nights later as a vicious, hateful Vampire, in defiance of all things good and natural. Uncaring of the life he had before, the Red Duke now takes residence in the cursed city of Mousillon, warring endlessly against King Louen, desiring that Bretonnia yield entirely to him or face total annihilation!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_inf_chameleon_skinks_blessed_0	With skin able to mimic the patterns of their surrounding environment, Chameleon Skinks are able to sneak within a few arms' lengths of their enemies. From their ideal ambush position, the well-camouflaged Skinks will loose a hail of blowpipe darts, each tipped with the venomous secretions of a Lustrian tree frog. The poison is so virulent that it can even boil the foul blood in a Daemon's veins. Chameleon Skinks are exceptionally accurate, able to fire with unerring precision. They are aided by their large, protruding eyes which give them the means to focus on two different things independently, and to achieve all-around sight without moving their heads - a vital ability for a creature that stands completely still in order to blend in with its environment. Last, but not least, the Chameleon Skinks' eyes have a telescopic ability, enabling them to zoom their focus upon a target. Even heavily-armoured foes are not safe, as the Chameleon Skinks can aim at the more vulnerable joints or thread a shot straight through a miniscule helmet slit.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_black_knights	In the times before the Empire, there were few domesticated horses, and horsemen were exceedingly rare. In most tribes, a steed was a symbol of wealth and status. So it was often that only a Chieftain and his closest warriors would ride mounted into battle, the wealthiest of their number clad in crude iron plate and carrying stout shields. When these early Knights died, their horses were ritually killed and buried in the barrows alongside their masters, to carry them in the afterlife. Many centuries later, the Vampire Counts are known to summon forth the gruesome remains of those ancient Knights in order to bolster the masses of lesser Undead minions under their control. As a Vampire stalks through barrows and mausoleums, Dark Magic swirls invisibly around him like a cloak, probing and penetrating the cracked and overgrown porticos of each resting place and saturating the bones of the armoured corpses within. A thousand years of dust shifts and dissipates as the parchment-dry cadavers twitch and sit upright. In a morbid mockery of their old lives, these Black Knights stir into motion, tearing themselves free of thorny creepers and thick cobwebs, cold fingers clamping around the hilts of age-blackened blades. Alongside them, the skeletal remains of their steeds jerk to Unlife, twisted by magic into hellish mockeries of the noble beasts they once were.	true

His elite bodyguard bear mirrored shields so that Sigvald might bask in his own divine glory, and dozens of exotic females attend to his every whim and desire. Such are the depths of Sigvald's self-obsession that he will even call his retainers to attend him with their mirrors in the midst of battle, preening and murmuring compliments to himself as man plunge into battle and die all around him.	true

For the High Elves, white is the colour of purity and integrity and of death, and their robes symbolise their determination to fight to the end, no matter what horrors await them on the battlefield. Once trained, an archer serves in his regiment for a decade or more, forsaking all previous allegiances. There, he will learn how to send volleys of arrows high into the air, so that they scythe into the enemy ranks from above, and when to hold fire against a charging foe, so that every shot cripples or kills. Most of all, he learns to focus his pride into a courage that will allow him to stand his ground.

By tradition, only the most gifted are welcomed into the Sisters of Avelorn for, just as the Everqueen embodies all that is ideal and unblemished in the Elven race, so too must her chosen guardians; not only in mind and body, but also in pursuit of the spiritual. Such measures serve to raise the warriors of the Maiden Guard above the petty intrigues that often pervade the Everqueen's court, ensuring that they remain incorruptible.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_dwarf_warriors	Dwarfs make formidable fighters - they are strong and extremely resilient, broad of shoulder and wide of girth. Although by no means quick, they are physically robust and can maintain a steady plodding pace, marching for days on end despite being loaded down by burdens and heavy mail. When they charge into battle, the momentum generated by their wide, armour-clad bodies is remarkable, hitting the foe with a resounding impact. They have broken many enemy battle lines this way, splintering Elven phalanxes, carving through Orc formations and hacking apart the great masses of Skaven that make up their verminous armies. Protected by their heavy mail, their skilful use of overlapping shield walls and, finally, by their own tough and obstinate nature, Dwarf individuals, units and armies as a whole seem able to absorb punishing blows that would cause other races to break and flee. With Dwarfs, such suffering only serves to make them angrier - and with beards bristling and hands clenched around axe hafts and mighty warhammers, the Dwarfs regroup to charge anew. Their feeble-limbed foes, too worn out and tired at the end to even lift their weapons, are slaughtered, save for those fast enough to flee the iron-shod and implacable advance of the Dwarfs.	true

When thrown, the sphere shatters, releasing billowing clouds so lethal that mere skin contact can cause severe pain or even death. Breathing the vapours causes lungs to spontaneously fill with bubbling pus - a horrible and nearly instantaneous death. For this reason, Bombardiers wear all manner of elaborate masks, goggles and cumbersome rebreathing apparatus in an effort to protect themselves against accidental gassing. Armour offers no protection against poisoned gas, but this does not stop the Bombardiers from wearing arcane body armour underneath their robes.	true

It takes many years of dedicated service for Men-at-Arms to be so promoted, and even then only an act of bravery on the battlefield will guarantee ascension. Though no peasant may ride the steeds of the Bretonnian Lords, favoured Yeomen are permitted to ride to battle on draught horses. Such troops will often scout ahead of the main army and keep the Knights informed of enemy movements – a dangerous task, and one which earns no honour, so it is a task that the nobility believe is best performed by peasants. All Men-at-Arms dream of one day becoming a Yeoman, possibly because of the folk stories that tell of Yeomen being raised to Knighthood after performing a great service or some brave deed. The truth is that it is almost unheard of for a peasant to be elevated in this way – the nobility have no wish to sully their ranks with low-born commoners.	true

They know the rituals needed to draw forth spirits from the Realm of Souls and bind them once more into corporeal bodies. It is they who rouse the Tomb Kings and their courts from their slumber and awaken their armies for war. Liche Priests and Master Necromancers are also the keepers of Nehekhara's arcane lore.

Those who do not have a will of iron can die of sheer fright upon hearing the mournful screams of the Tomb Banshees.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_giants	Giants are monstrous humanoids with boundless strength and a prodigious appetite for violence, flesh, and alcohol. They are most often encountered in the far north of the world, being fond of cold, rocky climes. However, some do make the deep forest their homes, whilst others descend from lairs in the World's Edge or Middle Mountains to join bands of Beastmen. Those that live in the forest are a particularly vile example of their breed. Their skin is often covered in green and brown mould, fungus and moss, whilst their long beards are matted and tangled with ivy and creepers. Giants do not make common cause with the warherds, instead following in their wake, joining in with the slaughter and slaking their hunger on cattle and their thirst on looted barrels of ale. Occasionally one of the forest-dwellers might be bound to the will of a shaman by way of dark arts. Such a beast, emerging from the trees, trailing rotting litter, swathed in twisting vines and stinking of rank, woodland decay is enough to fill superstitious soldiers with heart-stopping horror.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_slayers	Slayers are the strangest and most deadly of all Dwarfs. They are outlandish doom-seekers, individuals who have wholly dedicated the entire fibre of their being to the hardest and most destructive life of battle that they can find. They take the solemn and binding vow of the Slayer Cult, oaths which oblige them to forevermore seek death in battle at the hands of the most deadly enemy they can find. Next, Slayers shave their heads save for a solitary crest - a fearsome plume which they dye bright and stiffen so that it sticks out at alarming angles. Then they begin their quest for a glorious death, deliberately seeking out mighty targets to destroy such as Trolls, Ogres, or even Giants. In times of battle, Slayers arrive from the wilderness to join a throng, lending their considerable combat skills to the Dwarf cause. Many desperate wars have been won by the ferocity and sheer determination of the Slayers. Although they prefer to hew down towering monsters, at need, they will turn their axes to scything down any enemy. Even when bloodied and battered after a battle's end, they will pause only long enough to slake their thirst before beginning their deathquest anew.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_chaos_spawn	Some amongst the Children of Chaos are bestowed with an abundance of the Dark Ones' gifts, becoming creatures whose bodily forms epitomise nightmare and unreason. Such creatures might once have been great Chieftains who called upon the favour of the Dark Gods one time too many. They might have been Bray-Shamans who drew too deep of the power of Chaos, their forms blasted beyond recognition by the raw power of Magic. It may even have been one who strayed too close to Morghur, Master of Skulls, whose aura of transmogrification changes all. In some cases, the creature might simply have been born that way, in all likelihood slaughtering its beast-mother in the process. When the warherd goes to battle, the Chaos spawn come shambling from their lairs. The Beastmen have no control over a Spawn's actions, and it will behave in a largely unpredictable manner. The Spawn will move towards the enemy and crash flailing into its ranks; teeth, claws, and tentacles tearing men limb from limb in a shower of blood and ruination before it is finally put out of its misery.	true

Most such warriors are conscripted into service, but a few muster willingly, having identified some manner in which the battle will play to their personal advantage. Many Dark Elves forsake melee weapons in favour of delivering death from afar. Armed with repeater crossbows - magazine-fed weapons capable of unleashing blistering hails of bolts - these Darkshards can take positions at the rear of the battlefield firing storms of iron-tipped bolts against approaching foes, or move forward to weaken the enemy line with a withering volley before the Dark Elf attack charges home. Though often scorned by other warriors for their distaste of close quarters battle, the Darkshards are unflinchingly proud of their marksmanship and are certainly no less cruel than their fellows. It is not uncommon for a Darkshard to forgo a killing strike to eye or heart in favour of a gut shot or other debilitating blow which, while ultimately no less fatal, guarantees that the enemy's last moments will be spent in mewling agony.	true

Armed with the enormous Axe of Dargo, Ungrim deals death - carving a path of red ruin before him while singing songs of old in a booming voice. Atop his head is a bright orange crest that rises above a study horned helmet set with a golden crown. For Ungrim is both a Slayer and a king, more than likely the last of the line of Slayer Kings of Karak Kadrin. Although Ungrim cannot seek his death in Slayer fashion, he grows ever more restless, leading the throng of Karak Kadrin into countless battles. Inspired by his High King and seeking to avenge his slain son, Ungrim marches to war with the least provocation. It was Ungrim who slew the Dragon of Black Peak and who broke Queen Headtaker's siege of King Belegar's citadel in Karak Eight Peaks. The Slayer King has beaten Ogre mercenary Golgfag Maneater and held off a Chaos army in the Battle of High Pass. Most Dwarfs are amazed Ungrim has lived so long, and none think that a mighty death in battle can be very far away.	true

Known amongst their kind as Chosen, their frames are swollen with unholy power, and with the gifts bestowed on them by the Dark Gods in recognition of the many fell deeds they have committed. These gifts are as varied as any other aspect of Chaos, but most mutations tend to be useful as weapons that aid the Chosen in his quest to inflict devastation on the civilised realms of the world. Even if a Chosen warrior bears no such stigmata, it is clear that he carries the grace of the Dark Gods from his aura of dark menace. The Chosen are truly the nobility of Chaos. The Chosen lead by example, fighting not as commanders but as elite warriors and champions. In this way, the Chosen hope to attack yet more of their master's favour and ascend to the ranks of the truly exalted. They advance unflinchingly through black powder firestorms, hails of arrows and punishing artillery volleys, their purposeful thread never falters as they march ever closer to their prey. Battle lines have buckled and broken at the mere prospect of a unit of Chosen closing in upon them, blades raised so that the methodical butchery of the foe can begin.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_general_captain_empire	The armies of the Empire are led by warriors who have been trained to direct their forces as effortlessly as a swordsman wields a blade. First and foremost amongst these great leaders are the Elector Counts, inspirational and famous individuals whose mere presence can steady a wavering battle line. The knowledge that their count is personally fighting beside them is enough to embolden the courage of a province's soldiers and strengthen their resolve. In practice, however, it is unfeasible for Elector Counts to command every force that must be despatched, for the Empire is a dangerous land, and its territories are forever under attack from savage monsters and marauding armies. Often, command is delegated to a trusted soldier considered to be an honourable leader of men, and this officer will lead the province's forces when the count cannot. Of course there are always exceptions, and some of the more bellicose counts, such as Valmir von Raukov of Ostland, have an unhealthy love for the clash of swords and the thunder of cannons, thus taking to the field of battle whenever they can. Many of the men appointed by an Elector Count to lead an army will also be nobles of the Empire, educated in martial pursuits from an early age - falconry, swordsmanship and hunting Beastmen in the forests. Others have risen through the ranks, having first stood amongst the rank and file with a bloody halberd in their hands. These officers vary greatly in standing, depending on the size of the force they lead, and can be known as captain, marshals, generals or simply commanders. Regardless of their station, the vast majority will be tried and tested veterans of many years who have a fine understanding of the craft of soldiering, having spent most of their lives fighting in defence of the Empire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_clanrats_0_summoned	The bulk of most Skaven armies are formed of Clanrats - a vast and verminous horde of ratmen that make up the warrior class. These Skaven belong to any one of thousands of clans scattered throughout the underground burrows, strongholds, and bursting cavern-cities that make up the Under-Empire. Of all the teeming masses, only the worker dregs, the shiftless Skavenslaves, are more numerous than the Clanrats. When a Warlord gathers his might for war, the Clanrats are front and centre, occupying a key place in the battleline. They form into great blocks to overwhelm a foe with their weight of numbers and the fury of their attack. If the Warlord can afford the price and is in reasonable standing with Clan Skryre, then a Weapon Team might accompany the regiment. These arcane devices of destruction are viewed suspiciously by the Clanrats, who frequently suffer due to their all-too frequent technical failures.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_zombies	Zombies are shambling horrors that stagger towards the enemy battle lines in a noisome horde. Grotesquely reanimated corpses, they are compelled by the Dark Magic of a Vampire or Necromancer, and driven by the will of their master to commit acts of extreme violence. To call the way a Zombie attacks "fighting", is perhaps to give the foul creature credit beyond its due. These sickening half-things have no skill to speak of, but are instead driven only by the insatiable urge to rend, kill and consume the living. Any warrior unfortunate enough to be pulled down by a Zombie horde will find himself torn slowly apart by a mass of desperate clawing fingers, his flesh gouged from his body in grisly, glistening chunks. The fortunate die quickly, but those unlucky souls who are trampled beneath the horde spend their death throes in miserable agony as their innards become a crimson feast.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_goblin_big_boss	Orcs determine their hierarchy in a simple manner - the biggest and best fighter takes control. Goblins follow a less straightforward path to the top ranks, as they are both more devious and more cowardly than their brutish Orc cousins. Underhanded ploys and strategy are the preferred tactics for Goblins; although straight-up fighting is still an option, it is one that is typically left to the especially desperate. All Goblins use dirty tricks, with the best schemers being the most dangerous of their diminutive kind and the most likely to rise through the ranks. Those Goblins that make it to the very top are known as Warbosses or Warlords, although some of the more outlandish tribes might use more localised names such as a Wolf-khan, Grand Despot, Potentate, Bogtator, Chieftain-king or Great Grif.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cav_cold_ones_feral_0	Cold Ones are rapacious predators, fuelled by a savage blood-lust that drives them to attack any warm-blooded creature that comes near. They hunt in packs, and are perfectly capable of bringing down creatures many times their own size. As soon as they become aware of their prey, the pack will surge forth, some of their number harrying and snapping at their quarry, while the rest of the pack swings forward to left and right. Once surrounded, the unfortunate victim will quickly be dragged down and consumed. Cold Ones can be broken to the saddle, and are used as cavalry mounts by both the Dark Elves and Lizardmen. However, breaking them in this way tempers their normally savage nature, and although still ferocious compared to most mounts, it leaves them dull-eyed and sullen compared to their wild cousins. For this reason, Wizards will sometimes bind packs of feral Cold Ones to their will with a Scroll of Binding, and then unleash them at the start of a battle to surge uncontrollably forward and savagely attack the foe. Used in this way, a large pack of Cold Ones can inflict terrible harm, while smaller packs are ideal for snapping and biting at the flanks of the opposing army.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_art_eagle_claw_bolt_thrower	Eagle Claw Bolt Throwers that not only play pivotal roles upon the battlefield, but also bristle from the sides of Ulthuan's warships and the battlements of her fortresses. Eagle Claws can be found not only in Lothern, but throughout High Elf lands. The weapon's canny design allows its crew to alternate fire modes at will - it can loose single shots capable of disembowelling a rampaging Giant, or clutches of six lesser bolts to mow down massed infantry before they reach the High Elf lines. Such is the skill of The Eagle Claw's Sea Guard crew, and the speed with which they reload, that only seconds separate one deadly volley from the next.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_wildwood_rangers	Athel Loren is not a safe place, even for the Elves. Even now, thousands of years on from the first Great Council, there are those forest spirits who resent the Elves' presence, and visit upon them whatever cruelties are in their power. Banished to the sinister south-eastern corner of Athel Loren known as the Wildwood, these dark spirits rail against the Waystone fence that confines them and dream darkly of revenge on those who have occupied their home. The task of guarding the border between this shadowy prison and the rest of Athel Loren falls to the Wildwood Rangers. Theirs is an existence thoroughly at odds with the gaiety and splendour known by other Wood Elves, for just as the creatures of the Wildwood do not rest, nor can those who have sworn to keep them trammelled. The waystone fence is ever under attack, and it suffers disruption more often than any care to contemplate. Any breach, however small, brings with it the risk of carnage as the dark spirits slip loose from their bonds and wreak all manner of havoc in the forest beyond. The Rangers converge on such breaches within moments of their formation, holding back the tide of dark spirits long enough for Spellweavers to make the waystone barriers whole once again. Thus must the Rangers be ever-vigilant, so that their kinsfolk need not live in fear.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_grail_knights	Only when a Questing Knight has proved his valour and purity beyond all doubt does the Lady of the Lake appear to him in a vision, rewarding him not only with the sight of the Grail, but also permitting him to drink from it. Few indeed are allowed to sup from this, the holiest of Bretonnian artefacts, and only those Knights of unblemished purity survive a taste of the blessed waters from the chalice. Those who drink from the mystical chalice are changed forever, granted lifespans many times that of normal men, as well as other, stranger gifts. From that moment on they are irrevocably committed to the service of the Lady and the Grail, a bond that can only be broken by death. To the commoners of Bretonnia, Grail Knights form a pantheon of living deities, their names spoken as a reverent mantra throughout the land, and are often worshipped in their own right. They are tireless, and know neither fear, hardship nor despair, their words and deeds immortalised forever. Some five centuries since his death, many still recount how the eyes of Riquiard of Brascard glowed with a terrible light as he slew the enemies of the Lady, while others speak of a golden aura that protects all Grail Knights from harm. Amongst the most famous of all, Laudyricus of Couronne, was believed to have been possessed of a heart so pure and noble that he was anathema to all unclean creatures and could slay them with his merest touch.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_wurrzag	Wurrzag Ud Ura Zahubu is a Savage Orc Shaman of mighty mystical powers. Known as "Da Great Green Prophet", he is guided along his path by the Greenskin gods. He leads tribes to greatness before wandering off to pursue yet another mad plan to advance Orc-kind. Wurrzag's green crusade began in the Southlands when, with the magical energy that arched uncontrollably out of his eyes, he transformed the former Shaman of the Bone Nose tribe into a Squiggly Beast. As the tribe prepared to ritually eat Wurrzag for this deed, the marinated Orc entered a trance and spouted a tale of long ago, when the now-sorry Bone Nose tribe ruled the lands. The cold-blooded ones came and built great pyramids, driving the tribe away and destroying their idols. Since those shameful days, the tribe has lived under a curse. Wurrzag rekindled their spirit of conquest and, filling in for their transformed Shaman, led the Bone Nose warriors to level the nearest Lizardmen-city. Using the rubble of the wrecked pyramid, Wurrzag ordered the Greenskins to erect two edifices. To this day these same stone-faced idols watch over the Bone Noses, and the tribe's fortune has grown.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_slann_mage_priest_light_0	The favoured servants of the Old Ones, the Slann have considerable intellect and magical abilities, and rule the Lizardmen as venerated Mage-Priests. Although not physically menacing - their bodies are toad-like with large heads and bulbous eyes - with a flick of their multi-jointed fingers, Slann can topple cities, engulf foes in flames or open vast rents in the ground below. Enemy Wizards find even the mightiest incantation they try to employ unravelling before them as the Slann contemptuously waves its hand. The Slann see the world differently from other beings. Their orderly minds are constantly at work - deciphering complex problems and wandering the cosmos. They sit unmoving on their stone palanquins or in their Star Chambers, and to an outsider a Slann might appear asleep, or even dead. So deeply do they meditate that signs of life are hard to detect - their breaths are shallow and far apart, their eyes unblinking and vacant. Yet the Slann are attuned to more than mortals realise - for they can perceive the magic and raw disorder that has hung in the very air since the great influx of Chaos.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_master_engineer	Given the number of war machines with which the Dwarfs can equip themselves, it is not surprising to find members of the Engineers' Guild accompanying a throng to battle. To most Master Engineers, this "field work" is tiresome, as it takes them away from their forges and workshops and shows them first-hand how their beloved engines of destruction are dragged into position, dented by enemy shot and not as fully optimised as would be ideal. As all Dwarfs revere fine craftsmanship, their war machines are the most polished and best cared-for in the world, treated by their crews with all the respect due a venerable Clan member. Nonetheless, even this level of care falls well short of the wishes of the notoriously cantankerous Engineers. Master Engineers are doughty warriors who, although more interested in drafting plans for fortifications or designing new mines, are more than capable of fighting in the frontlines. To protect their precious war machines, they fight with all the determination and grit of their race.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_inf_depth_guard	Depth Guard are the most feared soldiers of the zombie pirates’ fighting dead. Like their land-based counterparts, the Blood Knights, they are elite, Vampiric sentries clad in ancient, eldritch armour and bolstered by the Vampiric curse. Unlike the mobs of Undead crewmen, Depth Guard are not raised from the rabble who died on the oceans, and instead are hand-picked warriors who were given the Blood Kiss before being taken aboard pirate warships to serve their masters closely. The indefatigability of the Depth Guard means that any normal blow or bullet that strikes them has little chance of stopping them in a fight. They will trudge forward and fight unrelentingly until their bodily remains are utterly obliterated or their master’s control over them is broken.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_mon_rat_ogres	The hulking monstrosities known as Rat Ogres are one of the most successful of Clan Moulder's numberless creations. The Master Moulders have found the perfect blend of death-dealing creature through a mixture of foul crossbreeding and dark sorcerous surgery. In their artificial making, many beasts are literally stitched together, the impossible feat accomplished through the fusing powers of a powerful Warpstone-derived balm, the infamous skalm. The Rat Ogre combines the speed and ferocity of a Skaven with the sheer brawn of an Ogre. Somehow the desperate hunger of both races has been magnified as well - for the Rat Ogre is truly a ravenous creature, forever seeking to gorge its fill on fresh meat. In battle a Rat Ogre pack is horrifying to behold, becoming wholly consumed by an insatiable instinct to kill, rip, and tear, and it takes a Packmaster to steer their ferocious charges. A Rat Ogre pack moves with great speed, their misshapen bodies made entirely of straining, bulging muscles, teeth, and claws. The snarling rage of a Rat Ogre pack colliding with an enemy unit resounds across a battlefield, as the towering creatures splinter shields, snap bones, and relentlessly pound any and all opposition.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_throgg	At the heart of an icy labyrinth, in an area of Troll Country strewn with the gnawed corpses of once-mighty heroes, sits the Troll King, Throgg. With the filth-encrusted heirlooms of eaten warriors decorating his yellowed tusks, he strikes out from his wind-whipped wasteland home to ambush, despoil, and feast. On his heels follows the bitter cold of winter, and his subjects - stinking monsters, drooling mutants, and tormented madmen. The slaughter he leaves in his Wintry wake has earned him such infamy that every season, great and lauded heroes ride northwards to attempt to slay him – and every season, the Troll King dines on their flesh. Disenchanted with these incessant, petty challenges, Throgg vows to bring about an age of ice and darkness and make all races of the Old World his slaves.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cha_noble_4	High Elf Nobles are the leaders of their own respective armies and companies, warriors whose skill at arms and years of experience far surpass those of any other mortal race. The noble families of Ulthuan have led the High Elves through times of peace and conflict for thousands of years. They pride themselves on a deep sense of honour, as well as the mastery of both diplomacy and war as art forms. The High Elves believe an existence lived without precision to be hollow, and scarcely preferable to death. Any Elf noble is just at home fighting with a sword in bloody melee as he is loosing deathly-accurate arrows from afar, or even dictating the strategy of a campaign from a greater distance still. Though they are loyal to the Phoenix King even unto death, all High Elves of noble blood love intrigue and politics. Unfortunately, this sometimes means that armies are trusted to individuals based on political alignment, rather than on ability. Fortunately these instances are rare -- when the safety of Ulthuan is at stake, few Phoenix Kings have suffered such idiocy for long.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_cannon	Cannons were first made by the Dwarfs of Zhufbar, although now, many of the larger Holds make their own. One of the most potent war machines, a cannon can shatter the most heavily armoured foe, pour shot into massed enemy formations, level a foe's cities or fortifications and topple the largest of monsters. They are, however, somewhat temperamental devices, and even the best-forged cannon in the world (those made by Dwarfs, naturally) are subject to occasional malfunction. The slightest crack or premature ignition of black powder can result in devastating accidents. In addition to the cannons housed within Holds, many Clans maintain a number of cannons that can join a throng on the march. These are hauled into overlooking positions on the battlefield where their long range and potent shot can dictate the course of the enemy's actions. Give the quality of their make, many Cannons have been in service for a number of centuries and are revered by their crew.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_gor_herd	Gors form the great mass of the warherds. Their appearance varies, but all combine bestial features with those of a man. The base form of the Beastmen, and that possessed by the vast majority of the Gors, is the head and legs of a goat and the upper torso of a man, albeit a particularly hairy and malodorous one. They have the savage fangs of wolves with which to tear great chunks of flesh from their foes, and muscular and robust (if flea-ridden) bodies well suited to acting out their primal urges. To face a horde of Gors is to face anarchy and mayhem. Rowdy and undisciplined, they bray, bark, and bawl an unceasing cacophony that fills men's hearts with dread. Nonetheless, Gors are capable of taking to the battlefield in more or less ordered formations, a fact that many an enemy general has failed to understand until it is too late. Roving groups of Gors band into tight units that march beneath banners made from the flayed hides of their foes, while others tear the captured flags of defeated enemies, tattered and smeared with blood and dung. The Gors' raucous, bloodthirsty braying is accompanied by the atonal drones of crude pipes and horns in deliberate mockery of the Empire's proud regimental musicians.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_luminark_hysh	A Luminark of Hysh is a large and complex magical war machine created by the Wizards of the College of Light Magic. Each consists of an array of enchanted mirrors and aether-lenses, resembling the innards of a vast magical telescope mounted atop a great wheeled platform. These mystical weapons are crewed by a pair of Acolytes - students of the Patriarch of the Light College himself - who tend to the machine's array of precision instruments. As the Acolytes set about focussing lenses, tilting prisms and polishing mirrors, they continuously intone spells to channel the Wind of Hysh. As the invocations gain in tempo and volume, the Orb of Sorcery at the machine's core glows with increasing ferocity until a blinding white light leaps through the Luminarium's arcane optics, manifesting in a destructive beam of soulfire so intense that it vaporises anything in its path.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_rangers	Rangers are the long-ranged eyes and ears of most Dwarf settlements. They patrol far from the safety of the Hold, often spending long periods out in the wilderness, keeping watch on the Dwarfs' many enemies and tracking dangerous beasts. It is they who explore hidden valleys, push through collapsed sections of the Underway and scale the cliffsides in search of new pathways. Rangers will hunt down and dispose of lone monsters or ambush small mobs of Goblins, but when they confront larger creatures or enemy armies on the march, signals are sent to the nearest outposts to alert them of the encroaching danger. When dealing with large enemy forces, Rangers will first attempt to forewarn all Dwarfs in the invaders' path before trailing the foe, picking off stragglers and waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc. In this way, when the foe finally confronts a Dwarf force, the Rangers will often be in position to outflank it, arriving behind enemy battle lines to destroy war machines, pincushion lone Wizards, or launch an attack to otherwise help the Dwarfs gain an advantage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_mon_sun_dragon	Dragons are amongst the oldest of all living creatures, even predating the rise of Chaos, and rode the thermals of ancient volcanoes long before warm-blooded creatures ruled the world. They are wise and aloof, viewing those around with a perspective only the eldest creatures can share. On Ulthuan, Dragons are the subjects of legends quite different to the terrifying folk tales of other lands. Without the Dragons of Ulthuan, the High Elves would have been annihilated thousands of years ago, for the Dragons are the Elves' oldest and greatest allies. Within Ulthuan, the realm of Caledor is the home of the Dragons, and in ancient days, those noble beasts seemed almost without number. However, times have changed. Now, in colossal caverns found deep within the Dragon Spine Mountains, the Dragons sleep away the centuries. A mysterious languor that began in the earliest years of Tethlis' reign has caused more and more Dragons to enter a slumber from which only ancient Caledorian songs can rouse them. Few young Dragons are hatched now on Ulthuan. The youngest are referred to as Sun Dragons, in reference to their hot tempers and the rich, warm hue of their scales. Those that surpass the Sun Dragons in might and enlightenment are known as Moon Dragons. The oldest and most powerful are referred to as Star Dragons, for they are truly as ancient as the very stars of the firmament. While any Dragon can savage an entire regiment of warriors, tear a Manticore apart or rip the head off of a Wyvern, a Star Dragon is so physically powerful that it can battle against even the Greater Daemons of Chaos and prevail.	true

They carry themselves with swaggering confidence, revelling in their own superiority over lesser beasts. Their thick, hairy skulls are crowned with magnificent sets of horns as sharp and hard as any blade, and their robust and heavily-thewed bodies are covered with scar tissue and crudely-rendered tattoos. The threat of violence is implicit in their every gesture. Upon the battlefield a Beastlord is a force of untold destruction, gouging and butchering with horn, blade and claw.	true

Regardless of whether a Goblin is a lackey under the heel of a domineering Orc or the member of a distinct tribe, they make for lacklustre troops. However, Goblins can defeat an enemy through sheer weight of numbers, especially if they can attack from a flank or even better from behind. Goblins prefer to attack defenceless foes and shooting arrows from a distance is likewise a popular type of attack among their kind.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_grudge_thrower	Catapults were one of the earliest of the Dwarf-made war machines and have been used to command the approaches to Dwarfholds for many millennia. During the War of Vengeance, so great was their fury with the Elves that the Dwarfs began the practice of inscribing grudges on the rocks being used as ammunition. This custom stuck, and many crew believe that the engine is only as good as the grudges it throws - and therefore spend as great deal of time carving their anger directly onto the shaped stone ammunition. Grudge Throwers are still used by all Dwarfholds and over the long years there have been many famous engines whose renown has spread far and wide across the Karaz Ankor and beyond. Perhaps most famous of all was the 'Gob-lobber', a legendary catapult which drove off a great many Greenskin attacks during the Goblin Wars - although this was more down to the crew's use of live gobbo ammunition rather than pure accuracy.	true

The Helblaster Volley Gun is the lethal creation of the deranged Engineer, von Meinkopt, and the terrifying reputation of this weapon has spread to all corners of the Old World. Its nine separate barrels are divided into three 'decks' and are turned by the means of a central crank, which means that it can unleash devastating hails of shot that shred its unfortunate target in a firestorm of leaden death. The serious disadvantage of the Helblaster is that it is notoriously prone to jams, misfires and explosive malfunctions. As a result, Helblaster crews are a morbid lot who tend to be paid up with the Priests of Morr.	true

While a solid cannon ball may plough through several victims, a Mortar shell explodes with tremendous force, scattering razor sharp shrapnel over a wide area and scything through whole ranks of enemy warriors. Firing a Mortar is always a tense moment, for the quality of fuses is highly variable and it is not unknown for one to burn through before the crew have finished loading the shell. As a result, Mortar crews tend to be superstitious and carry a large number of good luck charms about their person.	true

Early prototypes blew apart an entire floor of the Imperial Engineers School, but the soot-blackened Engineers persevered and succeeded in creating a deadly, if unpredictable, weapon. The shrieking rockets fired by this bizarre machine are wildly inaccurate weapons that have little chance of hitting anything other than (eventually) the ground. However, when these rockets do land on target, the results are devastating; entire regiments are blown apart by a series of earth-shaking explosions.

It was he who first forged a union between Elves and forest, and who argued with his fellow Elders that the binding be made permanent. In those days, he was ever a friend to the Children of Isha, always willing to help them broaden their understanding of forest and Weave. Alas, those days are long gone. Centuries of destruction and carnage have taken their toll on Durthu's valiant spirit. He bore witness to the rapacity of blooded life, and of the wanton destruction it has heaped upon his homeland. He has seen untold acres of trees felled for kindling or from simple spite. He has watched, time and again, as the Elves have invited calamity on the forest through an inability to sever their connection to the outside world. Worst of all, he has seen his fellow Elders fall, one by one; some slain by their own foes but most destroyed by the enemies of the Elves.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc01_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_sorcerer_shadows	Those Champions of Chaos who seek mastery over the magical arts are known as Chaos Sorcerers, and they are madmen and malcontents all. Chaos Sorcerers wield the wild energies of entropy itself, reshaping reality to better serve their whims and those of their dark masters. A word and a gesture from a Chaos Sorcerer can strip a man's flesh from his bones, force a lover to murder his beloved, or cause a regiment of soldiers to burst into flame. They are amongst the most awful and depraved of all servants of Chaos, for they long ago sold their souls in exchange for the heady elixir of pure power. Where many of the world's Wizards, such as those taught by the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, glean their arcane skill from long years of painstaking research, a Chaos Sorcerer's understanding of the Winds of Magic is instant and innate. However, without the patience and wisdom that such study brings, a Chaos Sorcerer lacks due wariness and respect for the ultimate dangers of magic, and so begins an inexorable descent into deformity and madness. Many are the paths that lead to this ultimate fate, but most often, the Chaos Sorcerer seeks to expand his magical powers or harness more of the occult by simply bartering away another fraction of his soul, losing a little more of his humanity in the process. Before long, the aspirant feels his whole body and mind twist and alter, and as the gnawed remnants of his soul are finally devoured, he is plunged into the whirlpools of insanity, leaving behind nothing of the man who was.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_centigors	Centigors are a disturbing cross between four-legged creatures, such as horses and oxen, and the bipedal beasts of Chaos, merged together by the Ruinous Powers in ages past. They possess the hindquarters and forelegs of their quadruped ancestors, granting them great speed and strength, but the upper body of a humanoid, with which they wield brutal weapons. Strong, vital and crude, these beast-centaurs are powerful creatures. However, they are not especially agile, and while they have great strength they lack the dexterity to manipulate objects with any skill or control. Centigors are bitter and spiteful, resenting their clumsy, awkward nature, and harbour a deep jealousy of creatures whose minds and bodies are better matched. As the sun rises and the warherds march from the herdstone to make war upon man, the Centigors rouse themselves from their stupors, taking up the weapons of the Beastmen and galloping to war beside them.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cav_necropolis_knights	Necropolis Knights are elite warriors who ride atop giant snake-shaped statues. Their monstrous mounts shatter bones with every swipe of their tails and sink scimitar-sized fangs deep into soft flesh. When Necropolis Knights are awakened to serve in the Tomb King's eternal army, the Necroserpents coiled above their resting places magically slither to Unlife as well; rider and mount are animated by the same warrior spirit, and they move as one being, riding to war in perfect ranks of terrifying cavalry. Necroserpents travel beneath the ground at a relentless pace, emerging from the depths with sand cascading off their forms, warriors standing proudly upon their hooded backs with spears lowered, ready to spill the blood of their foes. Serpentine bodies weave through the battlefield, bladed, fangs and tails lashing out in all directions, leaving a trail of death and woe in their wake. There are few who can stand against the charge of a Necropolis Knight, for they are incredibly powerful and difficult to destroy. As mount and rider share the same soul, only by destroying both can an opponent truly defeat a Necropolis Knight. Few foes are equal to such a task.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_ancestor_halkenhaf_stonebeard	With the Dwarf realm dwindling during the Time of Woes, Halkenhaf Stonebeard and his allies were initially successful in repelling the first few attacks against Eight Peaks. Like every gatekeeper before him, Stonebeard was a fearsome warrior, known for being able to move his axe with such incredible speed in battle that it would appear as a blur around him, like a rotor of a Gyrocopter in flight. Ultimately, the lesser warriors defending the Hold alongside him all perished, leaving him the last Dwarf standing. Refusing to leave his post, Stonebeard fought on, eventually meeting his end at the hand – or mouth, rather – of a hungry Troll. But it is said that he continued to swing his axe around wildly in a frenzy of slaughter, right up until he was picked up and swallowed whole down the monster’s gullet. With the gatekeeper defeated, the Citadel would be captured soon after.	true

She is not only the lone Witch Elf allowed to use Dark Magic but is also one of the most powerful magic-users in the world, rivalling perhaps even Nagash the Great Necromancer, the Lords of Change, and Teclis of Ulthuan. She has struck Daemonic pacts with many vile and disturbing forces, and can unleash the terrible power of Chaos upon those who displease her. Morathi's entire existence has been one of scheming and manipulation. Who knows how many of Aenarion's darker deeds sprang from seeds she planted within his mind, or how the history of the Elves might have been different if he had not taken her as his wife. Yet for all her beauty, she was ultimately spurned by the Phoenix King. Heartbroken, Morathi swore that if her husband could no longer rule the Elves, her son would do so in his place.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_mon_phoenix_frostheart	As a Flamespyre Phoenix ages, its body cools, and even begins to sap heat from its surroundings. Finally the plumage that once blazed with fire grows heavy with frost and ice. Once this occurs, the Phoenix must leave the Flamespyres, for the chill that surrounds it causes agony in its brightly burning kin. Most such Frostheart Phoenixes dwell in lonely exile on crags about the Eataine Coast until their bodies finally freeze solid, to leave curious frozen statues along the crags and cliff tops. The ice that sheathes its form is as hard as glass, and its enemies find their own strength and resolve eaten away by its chilly presence. Knowing they can no longer resurrect themselves in magical fire, the Frostheart Phoenixes fight even harder in the defence of their homeland, determined to end their existence striking a final blow against the enemies of Ulthuan.	true

Their origins are unknown to most, but a millennium ago they were roaring the praises of the Dark Gods as they despoiled the lands of men living in the area that would later become the Empire. Then, one day, the Gods abandoned them in favour of man. Despite hating mankind, the Fimir have a common cause with the Norscan tribes, as they both crave the attention of the Dark Gods, but even so, it is an uneasy and fractious alliance.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cav_nehekhara_horsemen	Regiments of Undead horsemen race across the sandy planes mounted on the fleshless remains of their once-proud steeds, weapons lowered as they gallop towards their foes. These skeletal riders drive their heavy spears into their foes with bone-jarring force, using well-aimed thrusts that punch clean through torsos and rip open throats in a spray of blood. Those not impaled by the cavalry rider's razor-sharp spearheads are trampled into the ground by the thundering hooves of skeletal steeds. When the Liche Priests summon the Tomb King's army from their sandy graves, fully formed cavalry columns stride out of the pyramids at the head of the legions. When the enemy is sighted, the cavalry regiment's hornblower signals the charge and a deep unsettling discord reverberates about the desert. This otherworldly sound shakes the dust from statues, and a disquieting feeling of dread permeates across the battlefield. As one, the Undead steeds gallop towards their quarry, the skeletal riders raising their shields and lowering their spears in perfect unison. It is a brave foe indeed that does not flee as these deathless horsemen bear down upon them.	true

Even those blows that crack the outermost armour plates cannot penetrate deeply into the beast due to the Bastiladon's alternating layers of thick leathery skin and additional scales. Their incredibly thick and armoured hides allow them to carry devices which other beasts, even the revered Stegadon, steadfastly refuse.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_knights	Chaos Knights are feared throughout the Old World and beyond as merciless butchers capable of turning the course of battle with a single charge. They are towering brutes atop immensely powerful Chaos Steeds, rider and mount clad in thickest plate, each section of armour crafted by a master Daemonsmiths. A Chaos Knight's greaves are jagged blades, well suited to slicing through the flesh of the enemy. Even the frightful reputation of the Chaos Knights is a weapon in its own right, crippling those who would stand against them before a single blow is struck. Many Chaos Knights ride to war with great lances, evil-looking polearms designed to impale and tear their foes. Others wield a deadly assortment of weapons, from cleavers and war-picks to heavy maces. Some Chaos Knights even brandish magical blades, each bearing a small measure of power. Regardless of the form or the hexes inscribed upon these ensorcelled weapons, they are all enchanted in order to kill, and most flicker with dark fire. Each Chaos Knight is a paragon amongst his warrior brethren, for he has trod the path of damnation for many years and holds the favour of the Dark Gods. A Knight's horned helmet may conceal a twisted and permanent rictus smile of sharp metallic fangs, or a striking and cold beauty that steals the breath away. Few have a chance to find out, for those who behold the Knights of Chaos are but moments away from a grisly end. A full unit of Chaos Knights, galloping at speed, will hit a battle line like the mailed fist of the Gods.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_plague_monks	The Plague Monks of Clan Pestilens are zealots utterly dedicated to the spread of corruption and decay in the name of the Great Horned One. These devout disciples of disease are unique amongst Skaven society in that they are fanatically committed to their clan and its purpose of creating the ultimate disease. Once this plague devastates all surface-dwellers, the Skaven can rise up in the ruins and claim their proper inheritance - nothing short of the entire world - and the Great Horned Rat will know who brought his children to their rightful and preordained ascendancy and Clan Pestilens will sit over all and reign supreme. As the foul brethren march forward towards an enemy battleline, their chanting picks up its pace and the Plague Monks seem to incite themselves into a terrible rage. In combat Plague Monks hurl themselves into the fray with a fanatical ferocity, eager to bring death and destruction to their foes. They relentlessly attack with filth-encrusted blades, iron-tipped staves, or even their needle-sharp teeth. A Plague Monk's exposure to pestilence has rendered its toughened, boil-ridden skin immune to pain. The ability to shrug off crippling injury combined with their near-hysterical zealotry means that the only reliable way of stopping a Plague Monk attack is to wholly dismember them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_skin_wolf_werekin	Werekin are former champions afflicted by feral mutations, whom the Gods deem not yet worthy to join them as immortals. Although feared by the local tribes where they dwell, they are not hated and indeed, they are respected. For the Northmen believe that even those cast down have been chosen, and it is better to be chosen than to live your whole life beyond the sight of the gods. Werekin are much larger and more distorted in body than the lesser Skin Wolves, living in caves deep within the frozen wastes. In times when they are not being brought to war by the raiding tribes, they feed on offerings from the locals, or otherwise devour unknowing passers-by who happen to carelessly dwell too near to their dens.	true

He is one of the first-born kin of Krakanrok the Black, father of the Dragon Ogres. Kholek was present when the terrible pact with the Dark Gods was forged, pledging their race to an eternity of servitude in exchange for immortality. The sagas tell that Kholek's part in the bargain was such an affront to nature that the sun hid its face behind a bank of storm clouds and has never looked upon Kholek since that fateful day. True enough, Kholek's coming is heralded by roiling black thunderheads. Where the Herald of the Tempest walks, a raging storm blots out the sun.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_mon_kroxigors_blessed	Kroxigors are giant crocodilian relatives of the Saurus. They are hulking creatures, their bodies consisting of slabs of rock-hard muscle and massive jaws bristling with razor-sharp teeth. When enraged, they unleash their only form of speech - a blood-curdling roar that reverberates across the jungle. During times of war, units of Kroxigors are used as shock troops to batter enemy battlelines. In combat, formations of Kroxigors and Skinks prove unusually effective, with the Skinks able to pepper foes with poison-tipped javelins before crashing headlong into combat, where they are backed up by the crushing power provided by the mighty Kroxigors. Because of their massive frames, Kroxigors can easily reach over any intervening Skinks, allowing the reptilian giants to pulp more than their share of any foe.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_savage_orc_boar_boyz	Although Savage Orc Boar Boyz wear no armour save an occasional hidebound shield, they are remarkably hard to bring down. These nearly-bare brutes can ride through clouds of arrows and emerge unscathed (although perhaps much angrier). Even in close combat, Savage Orc Boar Boyz can withstand all but the most determined of blows. This is due to their sturdy hides, the thick-muscled, protective mounds of their smelly boar mounts, and their own mystical warpaint. While tough as old boots, Savage Orc Boar Boyz are better known for the prodigious damage they cause when they charge. They crash into enemy units with an unparalleled ferocity - boar tusks, crude axes, or flint-tipped spears that all jab, thrust and stab in a frenetic assault. In their recklessness some Savage Orcs even fight with a weapon in each hand, using their legs alone to clutch onto their mounts. These Savage Orcs are a whirling maelstrom of destruction, hacking and flailing with wild abandon!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_veh_khemrian_warsphinx	Khemrian Warsphinxes are giant leonine statues that wade through the ranks of their foes, crushing them underfoot as if they were nothing more than bothersome insects. Almost impervious to harm, their stone-hard hides protect them from all but the truest strikes; anything less than a direct hit from a war machine is likely to glance harmlessly away. Atop each Khemrian Warsphinx is an ornate howdah in which several Tomb Guards ride. These elite warriors direct their mount's actions as if it were an extension of their own mummified bodies, laying into the foes below with great, double-handed spears. Khemrian Warsphinxes are terrifying foes the face, and enemies that do not flee before them are swatted aside by stone claws or torn apart by fanged jaws. However, this is just a fraction of their full destructive power. When a Khemrian Warsphinx rears up above its prey, those lurking in its shadow are doomed. As the leonine monster crashes down, it smashes its boulder-sized limbs into the ground with appalling force. The resultant shockwave knocks foes off their feet, pulping organs and splintering bones. Those that survive this earth-shattering impact find themselves in a crater of broken, twisted bodies. However, there can be no hope for anything caught directly underneath the point of impact. All that remains of these crushed unfortunates is a fine, red mist that sprays over the victim's stunned comrades.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_hawk_riders	Many large birds of prey live in Athel Loren, especially where it covers the foothills, ravines and crags of the Grey Mountains. These hawks and shrikes grow to far grander proportions than similar species found elsewhere in the world, though why this should be remains a mystery. A fledging hawk raised by an Elf develops a powerful bond with its master, and will even bear him into battle. As time passes, rider and hawk become almost one creature, existing for the call of the Hunt and the thrill of the chase alone. These Warhawk Riders scout their territory for invaders, and are skilful enough to guide their steeds down through the trees to strike at intruders. Those who ride Warhawks display phenomenal agility and balance, able to launch volleys of arrows while their mounts flit and dart through the forest at speed. In this way, an intruder who strays into the Pine Crags and other mountainous realms faces not only the fury of the hawks, but also that of the Elves - as several Dwarf expeditions have found to their cost.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_light_wizard	The Lore of Light lies under the province of the Wind of Hysh and the symbol of the Light Order is the Serpent of Light. The Wizards of the Light College - also known as Light Wizards - are rarely seen without treasured tomes and arcane scrolls in hand. Light Magic is renowned for its powers of protection, yet a Light Wizard can also conjure blazing lights to bind and burn the enemy. This lore is the hardest to master, for the Wind of Hysh is particularly diffuse. To compensate, the Order employs many acolytes to aid its more senior wizards. This is unusual amongst the Colleges, for wizards of other Orders rarely take on more than a single apprentice at once. The pyramidal hall of the College of Light itself goes largely unseen; it exists within a magical aether realm, parallel to, but separate from, the mundane world. Deep in its labyrinthine dungeons lies the greatest sorcerous treasure vault in the Old World, which also serves as a prison for many evil artefacts. It is the sacred duty of the Guardians of the Light, an arcane society of the Order's most powerful wizards, to keep them locked safely away from the world.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_mon_tomb_scorpion	Tomb Scorpions are powerful creations of the Mortuary Cult, formed from a combination of stone, metal, lacquered wood and fused bone. Burrowing beneath the surface of the desert, they attack suddenly and without warning, exploding into the fray in a shower of sand. They are lethal foes, for a Tomb Scorpion's tail carries a potent sting that can incapacitate the largest foes, and they have powerful pincers that can slice a man in half. As they scuttle forward on eight segmented legs, they hack apart anything in their path. When the Tomb Kings go to war, the Liche Priests send out their magical call and summon the Tomb Scorpions into wakefulness. Those Tomb Scorpions that respond to the incantations will travel for leagues beneath the ground before clawing their way to the surface and falling upon their enemies with razor-sharp claws and stinging tails. It is a truly terrifying sight to behold the sands parting to reveal the monstrous form of a Tomb Scorpion, and very often, last thing that their enemies will ever witness.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cav_tiranoc_chariot	The High Elves of Tiranoc are an adventurous people, proud of their fighting traditions, and deeply embittered by the wars that have ravaged their realm. When the Phoenix King calls his subjects to war, the fiery knights of Tiranoc are always among the first to answer, riding to battle at the head of a mighty chariot host. Spear-points and helms gleam in the light of the rising sun, and the ground trembles beneath thundering hooves. Banners of white, gold and blue stream in the wind. As one, the charioteers give voice to the battle hymn of Tiranoc, a rousing and beautiful anthem, sung at the mustering of the host since ancient times. In battle, the Tiranoc Charioteers fight with incredible skill, deft reactions complementing the speed of their straining Elven steeds. Only when the enemy is sufficiently weakened do the Tiranoc Charioteers crash into the press of melee in a glorious massed charge, the steeds biting and kicking, the riders thrusting their spears into the black hearts of their foes.	true

This is no surprise, for the Saurus were created solely for the purpose of war and protection. The Old Ones cultivated this race of reptilian warriors, although whether they created them entirely, or raised them up from some primordial life form of the jungles, is not clear. What is assured, however, is their role and function. In the prehistory of the world, a time before the coming of Elves or Dwarfs, it was the Saurus who pacified the lands, fighting great battles and exterminating entire species in accordance with the Old Ones' plans. Although unable to master more complicated devices, Saurus use simple weapons to devastating effect - wielding obsidian-tipped spears and heavy clubs spiked with jagged stones. Using their great strength, Saurus can leave the roads and hack through the dense jungles of Lustria using brute force alone.	true

Much like the waves that crash endlessly against the Bretonnian shore, so too does Alberic never cease. Whilst many do not see his progress, it is affected slowly but with the inevitability of nature.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_mon_hell_pit_abomination	The Hell-Pit Abomination is a living mountain of misshapen flesh. The creature moves in a rippling tide of unnatural spasms, writhing like a worm and using its many limbs to pull and drag its hideous bulk forward. Various mechanical bits, such as wheels, cogs, and fluid-pumps have been grafted into the beast to ensure it moves at optimal speed and that the Warpstone mutated growth agents are regularly injected into the beast's hyper-fast metabolism. A multitude of heads dart out of the lumpen mound of muscle and bone at the behemoth's fore. The heads that snake out are all vermin-like, but some glisten hairlessly, like unborn rat monstrosities. Many have eyes, but no few are blind, twisting and craning to catch the scent of prey, hissing and snapping at the air with razor-sharp incisors. Many foes will flee from the unnatural sight of a Hell-Pit Abomination. Once in combat the Hell-Pit Abomination is relentless, dragging its bulk onwards to crush any in its wake. Hell-Pit Abominations are notoriously hard to slay and there are accounts of the beasts visibly healing wounds, regrowing severed limbs and rising from the dead to attack again.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_night_runners_0	Night Runners are the most common Clan Eshin warriors, although they are still secretive like all their mysterious clan. Trained to move at speed, Night Runners strike quickly to prepare the way for Skaven armies. Small furtive units sneak from the shadows to seize key terrain features, while larger blocks of Night Runners scurry ahead of the Skaven lines to harass and slow down the foe. Night Runners fight with blades in each hand, although many employ slings to rain death on enemy war machines or poorly armoured elites. A typical ruse is to slink off to the army's flanks, hoping to lure pursuit into a hastily prepared ambush.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_terrorgheist	In death, a Terrorgheist becomes a nightmare made real. Guided by its master's will, the monstrosity creaks through the clouds above the battlefield on blotch-skinned pinions, its rotten flesh and withered organs open to the night air. Clotted hanks of fur cling in patches to its skeletal neck, and its skull swings from side to side as it tracks its prey on the plains below. It is the deathly shriek of an Unliving Terrorgheist that is perhaps its most fearsome aspect. As the magics of Undeath are worked upon the beast, its cry is transformed from a simple but shockingly loud noise into a barrage of eldritch power. Some say the Terrorgheist's shriek is nothing less than the screams of the damned, channelled directly from the Realm of Chaos. It matters little to the Terrorgheist's prey, for so devastating is its sonic attack that is can cause a man to die of fright in an instant. By venting this unholy noise as it drives down upon its prey, a Terrorgheist can cripple an enemy regiment moments before it slams into the reeling survivors, slaughtering the rest with tooth and claw.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cav_deck_droppers	When Undead pirate fleets attack on the open ocean, the first thing their victims commonly see are the hideous, flying horrors known as Deck Droppers, appearing in advance of their masters’ ships to pepper enemies with bullets from above. A Deck Dropper comprises of a bloodthirsty Fell Bat and firearm-wielding zombie ‘rider’, or more accurately, a zombie being unwittingly suspended from the Fell Bat’s talons, slightly disorientated but not without the wherewithal to fire its hand cannon. Before an attack, the Fell Bats hang in a dormant state from the topmost spars high in the rigging of Undead fleets until stirred by the anticipation that the coppery tang of blood is about to fill the air. Diving amongst their own ranks to grab a zombie, they swoop above the bedlam of battle as their passenger uses their better vantage point to fire round after round into the groups of enemies below.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_sisters_of_thorn	The Sisters of the Thorn are Ariel's handmaidens. In many ways, they are equal and opposite to the Wild Riders of Kurnous, a sisterhood pledged to sorcery and subtlety where Orion's equerries know loyalty only to the glory of the Hunt. Where the Wild Riders are borne into battle on steeds as reckless as they are, the Sisters ride the Steeds of Isha - mounts whose viciousness lies hidden beneath a graceful aspect. Just like their mistress, the Sisters of the Thorn are eternal; they seem never to age and succumb to injury only briefly. Should one be slain, her siblings place her body upon a bier of root and ivy and bear it away to the hallowed halls beneath the Oak of Ages. There she slumbers away the weeks and months until the arrival of a new Spring, where the riot of magic and life-energy restores her to vibrant existence. Only if her body is irretrievable or mutilated beyond all recognition does the fallen Sister's spirit flee the mortal world, leaving her bereaved siblings to exact vengeance on her slayer.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_louen_leoncoeur	Louen Leoncoeur is the greatest leader of the Bretonnians since Gilles the Uniter. A mighty warrior-king, his subjects know well that he is the pinnacle of Knightly perfection and honour. Highly skilled on the field of battle and a master of tactics and strategy, Louen has never known defeat. Commoners and nobles alike speak his name with the same reverence, likening Louen to the mighty Companions of Gilles from ages past; some even say that the blood of Gilles runs in his veins. As ferocious yet honourable in diplomacy as he is in war, King Louen the "Lionhearted" is renowned far beyond the borders and Bretonnia itself, and respected by all. After more than twenty glorious years on the throne, Louen still appears to be in the prime of his life, though scholars whisper that he is close to his ninetieth year. It is said that he intends to turn his attentions to cursed Mousillon, cleansing it of taint and restoring its former glory. If Louen does this, the lands of Bretonnia will be united under his banner once and for all.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_spellsinger	Elves are intrinsically magical beings. In most, this talent is too weak to be developed, presenting itself as occasional forebodings, but in truly gifted Elves it can be shaped into a tool of great power. Such a boon is not without danger, for raw magic is a destructive thing if drawn upon unwisely. Whilst other Elves protect themselves from such ravages through ritual, the Spellweavers and Spellsingers of Athel Loren shield themselves by joining their minds to the forest's sleeping consciousness. Mages sometimes take to the field in pairs composed of one Highweaver and one Darkweaver. Whilst the Darkweaver unleashes flesh-shredding storms of sorcery, her Highweaver counterpart employs High Magic to bolster their allies. Yet the Highweaver has another duty - should the Darkweaver show signs of being overcome by the sorceries she wields, the Highweaver becalms the Winds of Magic, shutting off the flow of corrupting power, and thus holding the incipient madness at bay, at least for a while...	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_state_troops	State troops are paid as full-time professional soldiers, ready to answer the call to arms at all times. In addition to forming a standing army to repel enemy attack, state troops also serve as city guards, the fire watch and the enforcers of the law. However, most of the time these soldiers spend their days drilling and training with various weapons to the barked instructions of grim-faced Sergeants and veteran Marksmen. Every state trains its regiments to fight together, providing each other with mutual protection on the battlefield. State regiments often march to battle with detachments of differently armed troops to aid them. These detachments form up close to their regimental units, where they guard vulnerable flanks and provide battlefield support, either by joining their regimental units in the bloody melee of close combat, or by showering oncoming enemies with missile fire. Swordsmen fight shoulder to shoulder with Spearmen, the close range parries and ripostes of swords complimenting the longer reach of the spear. Handgunners and Crossbowmen fell their foes with withering volleys of fire, but should a foe survive through such salvos, a detachment of Halberdiers will bravely intercept them, cutting them down with heavy bladed pole arms.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_waywatchers	Waywatchers are silent sentinels, the guardians of the paths leading into Athel Loren. They are masters of concealment, and can lie unmoving and unnoticed for days on end before springing an ambush on a startled and unfortunate prey. Few warriors can match a Waywatcher's skill with a bow. Should they wish it, these silent stalkers can loose an unerring stream of black-shafted arrows in a heartbeat, or place a single shot precisely in the weak point of a foe's armour. Furthermore, Waywatchers are highly adept at the arts of disruption and surprise, often appearing silently next to a vulnerable enemy and vanishing as quickly before the body even hits the ground. Thus do any who enter Athel Loren run the risk of being slain without warning by the Waywatchers, cut down by unseen archers or falling prey to their cunningly-constructed traps.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cha_alastair_0	The White Lions have served as the personal guard of the Phoenix King since the time of Caledor the First. White Lion regiments are often despatched to join the armies of Ulthuan during times of particular danger, tasked with protecting High Elf generals and mages, or bolstering the overall  strength of the army. White Lions are renowned for their unflinching courage in the face of overwhelming odds and terrible horrors, protecting their charge whatever the foe and regardless of the danger to themselves.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_inf_harpies	Harpies make their nests in the uppermost spires of Karond Kar. Some claim they are the souls of slain Witch Elves given physical form, others that they are a manifestation of Khaine. They are certainly vicious enough for either to be true. In Naggarothi lore, Harpies are considered to be an omen of good fortune, and it is claimed that if they ever deserted Karond Kar, the city would fall soon after. Harpies are similar in temperament to the Dark Elves, for they delight in tormenting their victims. Hunger drives them to follow raiding fleets for months on end, soaring patiently in the skies until battle begins.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cav_terradon_riders_blessed_1	Terradons are large flying reptiles that have haunted the skies above Lustria since time immemorial. They are dangerous predators with sharp talons and pointed beaks that are filled with needle-like teeth. Many creatures fear to see the ominous shadow of their wide wingspan or to hear the shrill and piercing cries of their hunting packs. Skinks have mastered the art of riding Terradons by capturing their hatchlings at a young enough age that the beasts bond with their future riders - no easy matter considering the height and precariousness of Terradon lairs. There is a great demand for Terradon Riders as messengers and scouts, and they are exceptionally useful in battle. There, they streak ahead of the main Lizardmen force, the Skinks clinging to the flying reptiles' backs, launching poison-tipped javelins or slinging deadly fireleech bolas. Veteran riders, known as Sky Leaders, know to harass larger units, whittling them down to size before flying into combat to finish them off.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_minotaur_great_weapons	Minotaurs are massive bull-headed monstrosities that constantly hunger for hot blood and red meat. Often growing to twice the height of a man and far greater in muscular bulk, their thick-skulled heads are broad and ugly, and their horns can eviscerate with a single thrust. Many have the cloven-hoofed hindquarters of a beast and other deformities of the body that the touch of Chaos brings. Though less intelligent than Beastmen, they are unnaturally strong and powerful, and make formidable warriors. To the Minotaurs, the battlefield is a place of maddening excess. The scent of gore in their flaring nostrils drives them wild and they bellow their hunger for all to hear. They charge with a thundering impact, horns lowered to impale, then strike blow after blow against their hapless enemy. Once their victims have been hacked apart, the Minotaurs slake their thirst by tearing at the raw flesh with their gore-encrusted nails and gulping down great hunks of steaming meat whilst the battle rages on around them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_wild_riders	The Wild Riders of Kurnous are Orion's personal guard, each as aggressive and impulsive as he. They are fey and dangerous creatures who are no longer truly the Elves they once were. Now and forever, they are a part of the Wild Hunt's eternal glory. In appearance, Wild Riders are throwbacks to the ancient days of the Elves. Their weapons are things of crude iron, or even flint; their ceremonial robes and armour seldom more than the pelts of animals slain during their sacred hunts. Yet there is an otherworldliness and nobility about the Wild Riders that cannot easily be denied; the power of Kurnous flows through them as surely as it does through Orion.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_mon_kroxigors	Kroxigors are giant crocodilian relatives of the Saurus. They are hulking creatures, their bodies consisting of slabs of rock-hard muscle and massive jaws bristling with razor-sharp teeth. When enraged, they unleash their only form of speech - a blood-curdling roar that reverberates across the jungle. During times of war, units of Kroxigors are used as shock troops to batter enemy battlelines. In combat, formations of Kroxigors and Skinks prove unusually effective, with the Skinks able to pepper foes with poison-tipped javelins before crashing headlong into combat, where they are backed up by the crushing power provided by the mighty Kroxigors. Because of their massive frames, Kroxigors can easily reach over any intervening Skinks, allowing the reptilian giants to pulp more than their share of any foe.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_death_runners_0	Most suspicious deaths and acts of espionage in Skaven society are blamed on the nefarious Clan Eshin. Such accusations are probably true, but, of course, there is no evidence. Much of this devastation is wrought by the Gutter Runners, Clan Eshin's black-clad death squads. Death Runners are the elite among their ranks, having excelled at the mysterious Far Eastern fighting styles for which Gutter Runners are known and demonstrated enough wherewithal and self-determination to lead. Because of their ability to bend and contort their pliable bodies with a speed and dexterity unachievable by man, Death Runners have no need for encumbering armour - they simply dodge the blows and missile of their foes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_tomb_prince	Each of the kings of ancient Nehekhara had many heirs, doubtless the result of their extensive harems, but only one could succeed their father to the throne. This was typically the second son of the king, for the firstborn were given to the gods to serve in the Mortuary Cult. The king's younger sons served as the generals and lieutenants of his armies and enforced his will over his subjects. Upon their deaths they were entombed beside the great tomb chamber of their sovereign, in an eternal council of war, waiting for the moment of awakening when they will resume command of their Undead legions.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_def_mon_kharibdyss_0	The Kharibdyss is a loathsome beast of the uncharted depths, goaded to war by the Dark Elves. It is brutish and slow-witted at heart and simply rampages wherever hunger leads it. It is one of the most formidable weapons under Druchii command. Its slimy body, adapted to resist the pressures of the ocean, is unstoppable on land, possessing colossal strength and incredible fortitude. Smaller foes are simply swept into its maw by its crown of flailing tentacles. Larger foes are entangled and held fast whilst razor-sharp teeth feast upon their succulent flesh. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_mon_necrosphinx	Necrosphinxes are nightmarish beasts of destruction that glide through the air in bounding leaps before falling amongst their terrified prey, scything down the living as mortals reap the wheat of the field. None can stand against such terrifying beings, and only when all before them have been butchered will they stop. A Necrosphinx is a bizarre and horrifying statue - a strange amalgamation of the mythical beasts that are said to inhabit the Nehekharan Underworld, maintaining order amongst the honoured dead. It has a torso and face of a man, and is armed with gigantic, scything blades that can sever the neck of a Dragon in a single slice. Many also have a scorpion-like tail, better enabling them to stand sentry against the predations of evil. Finally, sprouting from the statue's back are a pair of ornate wings which mimic those of the falcons that circle the highest levels of the Underworld, keeping watch so that the souls of the damned may not escape.	true

They are bulky creatures whose heads are covered by armoured crests, out of which project massive horns. With bony scales and spikes shielding their bodies, there are few predators that dare challenge them. Reared by teams of Skinks who stay with them throughout their lifetimes, Stegadons grow to become very protective of those they have known since they were hatchlings. Large howdahs are attached to the beasts' backs, and from this protected vantage point the Skinks hurl a storm of poison-tipped javelins or fire huge arrows from the mounted great bows known to the Skinks as 'Sotek's Curse'.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_great_cannon	The Great Cannons of the Imperial Gunnery School are the terror of the Empire's foes. Their thunderous fire sends iron balls hammering into the ranks of enemy warriors, each impact ploughing bloody furrows through tightly packed regiments. Even the mightiest creatures cannot ignore the power of a Great Cannon, as was ably demonstrated at the Siege of Middenheim, when Master Gunner Pumhart von Steyr decapitated a raging Dragon with a single well-placed shot.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_veh_doomwheel	Few devices sum up the blend of science and sorcery, the sheer inhuman ingenuity of the Skaven, than the infernal war machine known as the Doomwheel. At first sight the Doomwheel might seem an oddity, perhaps even comical to opponents that have not faced one before. The Dwarfs, who have suffered many wars against the Skaven, know full well the Doomwheel's measure and will direct every war machine at their disposal to blast the deadly wheel apart before it can churn close enough to pulverise the Dwarf battlelines. Indeed, Dwarf cannons will allow themselves to be overrun by the foe, willingly sacrificing themselves for their Hold in order to get off a single shot at the infernal Skaven device. When it works correctly, the Doomwheel whirs quickly across the battlefield, moving more swiftly than galloping horses. If it is going exceptionally well, the Warlock Engineer will even steer the great wheel towards the enemy. This is ideal, as the powerful Warp-lightning bolts fire out, blasting the nearest thing to shrivelled blackness, so it is best to be nearer the foe!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_mon_sepulchral_stalkers	Sepulchral Stalkers are massive, reanimated sentinels created by the ancient Nehekharans to delineate the borders of a king's realm. Over the centuries, they have been swallowed by the shifting sands of the desert, and they now lie hidden beneath the dunes. Sepulchral Stalkers are statues that have the body of a snake and the upper torso of a man. Atop the statues' curved spines sit inhuman skulls, inside which glow eerie, baleful lights. Lying beneath the surface of the desert, they wait for intruders to pass by before launching a devastating ambush. When the trap is sprung, several horrifying, snake-like forms burst from the ground to surround their prey. The Sepulchral Stalkers impale their foes on ornate staves before they even realize they are under attack. However, it is not for the skill with which they wield these weapons that Sepulchral Stalkers are so feared, for those who gaze into their eyes are turned into pillars of sand, standing as still as statues until a gust of wind blows them apart and scatters the grains into the desert. To literally look upon a Sepulchral is to look to your own death.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_warhounds	In Norsca, wolves and hounds prowl in the flickering shadows of the campfires made by the barbarian tribespeople of the frozen lands. The further north the tribe dwells, the more likely it is that the hounds that follow them will be mutants, their bodies swollen by the energies of Chaos. Brutish and bloodthirsty, the Warhounds of Chaos are natural killers built of muscle and fang that prowl the wilderness in ravening packs. They will even charge a spearwall with total abandon, their only concern the moment when their slobbering jaws sink into juicy, yielding flesh.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_emp_jade_wizard	The Wizards of the Jade Order embrace the Wind of Ghyran, symbolised by the Coil of Life. The wandering mages of this Order are druids who harness the energy of nature. Jade Wizards wear green robes and traditionally carry a sickle as a badge of office. They often walk barefoot to better feel the energy of Ghyran through their feet. A Jade Wizard's power is linked to the seasons, being vigorous in Spring, powerful in the Summer, waning over the Autumn and weakest in the Winter months. With a gesture they can summon forth forests to obey their commands, and with a touch they can heal fallen comrades. Jade Wizards tend to roam the dark forests where Life Magic flows more freely. There, far from the press and bustle of the cities, the Wizards learn from the trees of enemy movements and imminent threats, before returning to Altdorf with the news.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_inf_gate_guard	The mountain range to the north-west of Ulthuan face the Dark Elves’ kingdom of Naggaroth. It is no coincidence, then, that each of the mountain passes is guarded by a massive fortress, built around equally the massive gates through which the High Elves control access to Ulthuan’s interior – Dragon Gate, Griffon Gate, Phoenix Gate, Unicorn Gate, and Eagle Gate. Each fortress maintains a sizeable garrison whose duty it is to defend their gate to the very last Elf should the Druchii – or indeed anything else – come calling with host in tow and an aggressive intent. The Gate Guards populating its garrison are highly skilled in the operation of the various traps and war engines positioned at strategic choke points around the battlements and atop the gates themselves, adept at all forms of hand-held missile weaponry, and masters of hand-to-hand combat, lest any attackers achieve the unthinkable and begin to break through the extensive fortifications.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_ironbreakers	Clad from head to toe in suits of Gromril armour, Ironbreakers can survive in a treacherous world of rockfalls and sudden ambush. They stand resolute, barring danger from advancing beyond their post. It is an honour to be selected to join the Ironbreakers, for they are trusted to protect the Hold's most vulnerable entrances. Only the strongest and bravest are accepted into their ranks, but the dark offers no vainglory, and those warriors who choose a path of greater ambition must seek out the Hammerers. Ironbreakers are trained to fight in tight formations, wedged into the confines of narrow tunnels. There, they find defensible positions and let the enemy break upon their overlapping shields as waves crash into rock. Impervious, implacable and unmoving, they form a living line, Gromril-hard, that holds back the flood terror that lurks in the dark below. Enemies fall before their axes like Winter wheat before the scythe and blows clang harmlessly off their nigh-impervious armour or are caught and deflected by their sturdy shields. Such is the prowess of the Ironbreakers that they will often be called upon to fight on the surface - aiding the throng in time of a muster. However, for each battle under the light of sun or moon, the Ironbreakers will have fought dozens in the deep dark beneath the mountains.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_scurvy_dogs	Scurvy Dogs are vicious, Unliving beasts, herded into rabid packs by Undead pirates for use in their midnight raids. Most were wild strays from the filthy hovels of Sartosa, taken pity upon by drunken pirates and brought aboard ships as affectionate, if somewhat noisome companions. They are kept in a vicious state through pit fighting, entertaining the crewmen during the occasional prolonged periods of inaction. The dogs are rarely allowed to fight each other all the way through to death or crippling injury, however – their murderous abilities are saved for raids and boarding actions – but the accumulation of scars enhances their menacing appearance, making them ideal raiding companions who serve their masters beyond the death of both. As reanimated pets, they are much less affectionate and a whole lot more noisome, not that a bite from a Scurvy Dog is anything for an Undead pirate to worry about!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_vmp_corpse_cart	Corpse Carts act like magnets for Dark Magic, drawing their power from the land itself and re-animating the dead around them. Sometimes a Corpse Cart is hung with a great bell, the clapper of which is a fell lodestone of eldritch provenance. When necromantic magic is thick in the air, the bell tolls and ripples of Dark Magic emanate from the Corpse Cart. Under the influence of this ominous knell, the dead are drawn back together and cadavers stagger to their feet. Other Corpse Carts are lit by braziers that burn with infernal flames. The smoke from these 'balefires' contains particles of Warpstone that can drive enemy Wizards temporarily insane. Though most were hunted down and put to the torch, for more than a thousand years the remaining Corpse Carts have wandered along the back roads and dirt tracks of Sylvania, wearing death and misery like a shroud. On dark nights, they enter ramshackle villages, stirring the dead in their graves and filling the dreams of slumbering peasants with visions of rot and death. These strange constructs are valued highly by Vampires, for Undead creatures near a Corpse Cart will fight with frenetic vigour, bolstering the battle line of their armies.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_night_goblin_squig_herd	Cave Squigs are found far beneath the World's Edge Mountains. They are improbable creatures, part-fungus and part-flesh with spheroid bodies, beady eyes and gaping maws dominated by row upon row of dagger-like teeth. Night Goblins hunt Cave Squigs for a number of purposes. Squig hide is very useful and Squig meat is considered a delicacy. Some are captured and reared to become guard creatures or pets to affluent Boss-types (no other could afford to feed such voracious beasts). In times of need, Squigs are driven into battle to devastating effect. When all goes well, a Night Goblin Squig Herd can chomp through any opposition. When it goes wrong, such as when all their Night Goblin Herders are slain, the remaining Cave Squigs quickly disperse. Driven mad by noise and prodding, Cave Squigs are eager to scatter in all directions, snapping at anything in their way, including other mobs on their own side. Night Goblins, being a bit deranged, don't seem to mind such a risk - as long as it is somebody else being bitten in two by suddenly rampaging, wild Cave Squigs.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_mon_bastiladon_blessed_2	Known to the Skinks as the Bastiladon, this hulking quadruped is perhaps the most heavily-armoured beast in Lustria. It is a walking fortress, a living bastion covered in rock-hard bony skin, and then further protected by massive iron-like plates - a natural armour so dense that it can, sometimes, thwart the bite of the mighty Carnosaur. Even those blows that crack the outermost armour plates cannot penetrate deeply into the beast due to the Bastiladon's alternating layers of thick leathery skin and additional scales. Their incredibly thick and armoured hides allow them to carry devices which other beasts, even the revered Stegadon, steadfastly refuse. These revered and holy objects are mounted upon the great beast's back so that they might be activated to smite any who dare set foot in sacred Lustria.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_great_swords	Regiments of Greatswords garrison the castles of the Elector Counts and form their lord's honour guard on state occasions. These grim men are equipped with huge two-handed swords called zweihanders that can cleave an armoured Knight in twain with one blow. Greatswords are also adorned with superb suits of Dwarf-forged plate armour, for these elite troops are expected to fight in the thick of the bloodiest and most dangerous combats of a battle. Upon a soldier's induction into the esteemed ranks of the Greatswords, he is required to swear an oath never to take a backwards step in the face of the enemy. Every regiment of Greatswords has its own particular punishment for those who fail in their duty. However, such instances are extremely rare, and the history of the Empire is replete with heroic tales of regiments of Greatswords that have died to a man to protect the life of their liege lord, even after the rest of their army had been butchered.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_crypt_ghouls	Crypt Ghouls are ugly, stooping creatures with only a vestigial sense of reason. Their skin is sallow and filthy, their eyes are bestial and insane, and their snarling lips reveal sharp-pointed teeth in slavering mouths. Dressed only in the rags they pull from their victims, the Crypt Ghouls carry weapons they have picked up or have crudely fashioned from the remains of their unwholesome meals. These skulking fiends do not need such implements to kill, however, for they have long claws sufficient for their needs. These claws are encrusted with grave-filthy and decaying meat; those that take even the lightest scratch from their talons can die from unnaturally potent infections that spread through the victim's body. In addition, their constant diet of rot-fouled meat confers a sinewy and unwholesome resilience.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_knights_of_the_realm	Once a Knight Errant has proved himself worthy of his station, he is confirmed as a Knight of the Realm. Knights of the Realm make up the bulk of the nobility of Bretonnia and command great respect both for their station and for the deeds they have performed to reach it. Upon his investiture, a Knight is given the responsibility of administrating a domain – generally a few acres of land, a village and a castle. As the common folk in the domain are bound to his service, to work his land and pay their taxes, so too does the Knight swear fealty to the higher orders of nobility. A Knight of the Realm is duty-bound to defend his people and his land until death. As a noble trained in the arts of battle, he is expected to defend himself and his domain against minor threats without assistance from others. If the situation is more desperate, the Knight may either marshal the peasants of the village to fight with him, or instead shelter the commoners in his castle until help arrives from neighbouring domains. Above all, he is required to maintain the standards of Knightly honour, obeying the strict tenets of Bretonnian chivalry. Amongst the most important of these is to respond to the call to war, when a Knight will fight alongside his peers, not as a rite of passage, but as duty required by his station. There is no greater shame than to fail in these responsibilities, thus betraying the chivalric code. If he does so, he may be stripped of all titles and rights, and be banished from the realm until he can prove himself once more.	true

Of all the teeming masses, only the worker dregs, the shiftless Skavenslaves, are more numerous than the Clanrats. When a Warlord gathers his might for war, the Clanrats are front and centre, occupying a key place in the battleline. They form into great blocks to overwhelm a foe with their weight of numbers and the fury of their attack.

Only the strong and capable prosper, for the weak are weeded out and killed. They have no time for plough or sickle, for their tools are the axe, the sword and the shield. What their own lands cannot provide, they simple take from the lands of lesser men. The Chieftains that lead these warriors are a daunting sight, brooding hulks of muscle and hair whose bodies are covered in the scars and trophies of battle. Bearing weapons worn from dealing a thousand mortal injuries to those foolish enough to face them, these savage leaders are independent and fierce. These battle-hardened killers are the products of a people so steeped in conflict that, even in times of prosperity, they will fight to the death for the honour of leading the next raid. 	true

Witch-cursed and Chaos-tainted, these creatures are half-feral and subject to savage appetites. They were previously men and women who carried within them the tainted blood of the mutated beast, which was somehow unleashed. Half-insane with insatiable hunger, a Skin Wolf has shredded flaps of skin and chunks of bloody gristle clinging to it, left behind by the unfortunate individual who the fully-formed humanoid wolf-thing ripped itself from.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_cha_sorceress	Elves have a natural affinity for the shifting Winds of Magic. In the ancient days, they learnt the secrets of manipulating this mystical power from the Slann, the most powerful servants of the Old Ones. Yet for all their expertise, there was always a limit to the amount of power the Elves could harness - the risk of madness and spiritual corruption prevented them from delving deeper into the power of Chaos. It was Morathi who first ventured into this forbidden territory. Through dark rituals and bloody sacrifices, she moulded the energies of Chaos to her bidding. With this sorcery - the unrefined power of magic - Morathi soon began to weave enchantments and spells whose raw power far outstripped anything the Elves had previously known. To this day, Dark Elves study the sorcerous arts, utterly seduced by the unrestrained energy it allows them to command.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_fleet_admiral	The Vampires that lead the ranks of Undead mariners typically have centuries of experience. As long-living admirals, they can become a warship’s heart and soul – being Undead, however, those are two things they themselves lack. With the help of their Necromancy they are capable of impressive and sinister feats, driving their reanimated hordes forth in any confrontation, whether on land or at sea. The hiss of their orders can spur a crew to scramble and shamble to enact their master’s will and change the course of the warship – and perhaps, if the fates will it, the course of history. The first few Vampire Admirals were likely Sylvanian outcasts banished for one reason or another, or simply left Sylvania by their own accord after growing tired of the von Carsteins, enticed to take to the seas by the notorious successes of great Vampire Admirals such as Count Noctilus and Luthor Harkon.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_night_goblin_archers	Night Goblins are well suited to their subterranean existence. They range in size, but many are on the stunted side, which better enables the spiteful creatures to move quickly through the tight cavernways below ground. Night Goblins are easily marked out from other Greenskins as they wear long, dark, hooded cloaks, in part to blend in with the poorly lit tunnels but mostly to protect themselves from the hated sunlight should they venture above ground. Given a choice, Night Goblins only leave their underground lairs at night or when the sun is shrouded by cloud or gloomspell. When they do emerge, Night Goblins launch deadly raids, ambush travellers in mountain passes, and commit countless other malicious deeds. They are particular enemies of the Dwarfs, and the two races share a long history of bitter battles on mountainous peaks and below ground.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_slann_mage_priest_campaign_0	The favoured servants of the Old Ones, the Slann have considerable intellect and magical abilities, and rule the Lizardmen as venerated Mage-Priests. Although not physically menacing - their bodies are toad-like with large heads and bulbous eyes - with a flick of their multi-jointed fingers, Slann can topple cities, engulf foes in flames or open vast rents in the ground below. Enemy Wizards find even the mightiest incantation they try to employ unravelling before them as the Slann contemptuously waves its hand. The Slann see the world differently from other beings. Their orderly minds are constantly at work - deciphering complex problems and wandering the cosmos. They sit unmoving on their stone palanquins or in their Star Chambers, and to an outsider a Slann might appear asleep, or even dead. So deeply do they meditate that signs of life are hard to detect - their breaths are shallow and far apart, their eyes unblinking and vacant. Yet the Slann are attuned to more than mortals realise - for they can perceive the magic and raw disorder that has hung in the very air since the great influx of Chaos.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_blessed_field_trebuchet	The first Bretonnian trebuchet is believed to have been constructed in the small village of Lyonesse. It is said that an eccentric bastard child, a pious young man prone to fits and visions, built the war machine in a single night of feverish activity, using parts of the crumbling Grail Chapel of Adelhard the Second, as well as pieces scrounged from various other sources. When the village was attacked by northern raiders, it was this construction that fended them off, firing massive chunks of masonry to sink the marauders' longships. The young man was later presented to the king, and his designs copied and improved upon. For saving the village and maintaining the purity of the Grail Chapel (though it was now even more ruined than before), the young man was gifted with a fatted pig and two copper crowns - more wealth than he could have hoped to see in a lifetime.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_lord	Bretonnian Lords are powerful nobles whose deeds are recounted throughout the land, even by mighty earls, barons and the dukes themselves. Proud and powerful warriors all, Bretonnian Lords are excellent warrior-generals. Most of the Lords of Bretonnia were dukes of noble stock, such as Duke Behemond "Beastslayer" of Bastonne, and Theodoric of Brionne. They claim shared ancestry with the first Bretonnian king, Gilles le Breton, and many purport that their founders fought alongside him in his many battles. Lords are important and powerful figures both in the military and political world of Bretonnia, often trading sword and shield for cup and words in the halls of power; to play the game and advance their cause.	true

Their twisted features are often covered in a ragged hood, and they bear heavy braystafs as both brutal weapons and symbols of their position within the warherd. Bray-Shamans occupy a unique niche in the brutal and bitter world of the Beastmen; they have no need to defend themselves from other members of their tribe, for none would dare assault them. Not even the mightiest Beastlord would harm a Bray-Shaman, for they speak the will of the Dark Gods, and those that defy the Gods pay the highest price of all.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_bloated_corpse	A troop of zombie pirates is as macabre a sight as any Necromancer’s ghostly, rotting horde. The bodies of those brought back into existence as Unliving automatons continue to rot once they are reanimated, so necromantic admirals tend to raise crewmen from the freshest victims possible. Sometimes a corpse may have spent weeks floating in the ocean before it is raised, however, becoming swollen with noxious gases over time, its tissues seeping from rotten and tattered skin which blisters and turns to a greenish hue. In reanimating such a grotesquery to fight in their horde, a Lord essentially has a walking time bomb in their ranks, and a volatile one at that. It is far preferable to fight against such a creature at a distance, for when attacked, their tortured forms may suddenly disintegrate in a poisonous shower of decomposing internal organs and diseased fluids.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_exalted_hero	The frozen north spawns some of the hardiest warriors in all the world. Each is a paragon of deadly ability and lethal intent. Some ascend to command entire nations, some pursue the esoteric paths of the arcane, but the majority dedicate themselves to little more than the brutal butchery of all who stand in their way. These ruthless killers are known as Exalted Heroes. The history of many Exalted Heroes, recorded in scattered chronicles by the free people of the Old World, is a catalogue of woes and evil deeds. Their infamy shines bright as they capture the notice of the Dark Gods of Chaos with ever-greater feats of slaughter. They frequently seek out others of their kind to engage in ritual combat. When two Champions of Chaos clash, they duel to the death in the manner of gladiators, using the full force of every weapon at their disposal. When a victor emerges, bloodied but triumphant, he will cut a grisly trophy from his foe, claiming both his vanquished enemy's weapons and followers as his own. If the triumphant Champion has truly excelled, he may even succeed in attracting the attention of the Dark Gods and, in doing so, receive a more permanent reward for his deeds in the form of a mutation of daemonic gift. With each victory, he grows ever closer to becoming a Chaos Lord, with whole armies to command and Daemonhood within his reach.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_mon_black_dragon	Dragons once ruled the skies of the world. Now, their race is but a shadow of its former power and majesty. When the Old Ones arrived, the greatest Dragons found the world too warm for their liking and hid from the bright sun, while more still stole into caverns and the ocean deeps with the coming of Chaos. A Black Dragon is capable of slaughtering entire armies with its claws, horns and fangs. With expulsions of noxious gas from its maw, it can wither the lungs of its victims and desiccate their flesh. The thick hide of a Black Dragon protects it from even the weightiest blows. Perhaps the greatest weapon of all is the overwhelming Wyrm-dread that fills the enemy upon sighting such a bloodthirsty and destructive monster.	true

Countless victims are brought here to be sacrificed upon Khaine's altars. It was in Har Ganeth that the first ceremonies of execution were held. In the wake of a great victory over the High Elves, the guards of Har Ganeth led thousands of captives to the pinnacle of the temple and beheaded them with full ceremony and ritual. Such was the Dark Elves' delight when they beheld the bloodied heads tumbling down the steps that, from that day forth, executions became a regular feature in Har Ganeth society and a punishment for all manner of diverse crimes. Every Executioner carries a draich, the ceremonial weapon of his calling, forged by its wielder under the supervision of the armourers of Khaine's great temple. As an Executioner learns his bloody skills, he also refines his weapon so that the two are as one. Some Executioners prefer a heavy axe-like blade, others a slender sword, depending upon their own abilities and preferred method of killing. Regardless of design, these weapons are fearsome in battle, able to cleave through armour, flesh and bone with but a single, flawlessly placed strike.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_flame_cannon	There are few weapons that can put fear into the heart of a foe like the Flame Cannon, one of the deadliest inventions of the Engineers' Guild. A volatile concoction of hot oil and molten tar is mixed within the Flame Cannon before air is pumped into the barrel; soon the pressure inside is tremendous and the barrel is almost ready to burst. At precisely the right moment, the Dwarfs place a burning oily wad into the nozzle and release the pressure. The mixture catches fire as it whooshes from the barrel in a leaping spurt. The burning oil arcs into the air towards the enemy ranks and, with a little bit of luck, lands in the middle of the foe, spraying boiling tar over them. For longer ranged shots, the Dwarfs simply apply more pressure, and the most experienced crew know exactly when to release the straining valve to achieve maximum distance. Those crews who misjudge this subtle balance rarely get another chance. Enemies struck by the Flame Cannons have their flesh melted off them in a slough, leaving only scorched bones and foul-smelling liquid that is best described as "goo". Even the bravest of those who survive, after seeing their comrades so gruesomely reduced, have been known to flee immediately.	true

These are just the sort of qualities that Orcs greatly admire, so it was only natural for them to adopt war boars as their mounts.

As the Emperor is believed to be the living incarnation of Sigmar, all Electors may cast a vote to decide who is crowned the next ruler of the Empire, though they may not ever become Emperor themselves. In these dark times, where the curse of Undeath and the worship of Chaos infest the Empire, it is the duty of Arch Lectors to protect the populace and cast out such evils.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_inf_spearmen_0	Long ago, in a time of desperate need, the Phoenix King Morvael introduced a levy system so that all Elves could be called upon to fight for the defence of their homeland. These levies were organised into companies based within their cities, towns and villages. Morvael accurately predicted the need for a well-organised but flexible army to defend Ulthuan in the troubled times ahead. This system has stood the test of time and remains the cornerstone of most Elven armies to this day.

From fire-breathing Sea Dragons to the ravaging Kraken of the Great Ocean, the sea’s bounty is truly as varied as that of land-going life. Once dead, however, even the most belligerent creatures become infinitely more controllable to the seafaring Necromancers that terrorise the oceans. The Lustrian coastline is home to many such useful sea monsters, including the crab-like Prometheans which scuttle across the more shallower regions of the continent’s surrounding ocean floors. Standing as tall as fully-grown men, and with pincers that can dismember a man like giant scissors, they are distant cousins of the much larger and rarer Leviathans. Being relatively common in their known habitats, Prometheans are often targeted by Undead pirate fleets to be killed, reanimated, and brought into their fighting ranks, either as mounts or as monstrous combatants in their own right.	true

Like all their kind, Chaos Trolls can vomit forth the steaming contents of their guts, dissolving their victims with powerful acids and flesh-eating worms. They are also possessed of powerful regenerative abilities: lost limbs and even heads can grow back. However, Trollflesh is extremely susceptible to the mutating power of Chaos, and Trolls who have lurked too close to the Realm of Chaos find tentacles, screaming maws and even stranger mutations sprouting from their wounds.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_vampire_lord	As a Vampire ages, his powers increase. He becomes physically stronger and faster, until he is able to tear a man in half and move as fast as the wind. He is able to call upon a host of powers, the nature of which vary from Vampire to Vampire. Some can call forth creatures such as wolves and bats to assail the armies of the living, and sometimes they can even learn how to change into these forms. Others are able to mesmerise weak-willed mortals with barely a glance. If the Vampire has a strong affinity for magic, then his necromantic abilities expand both naturally and through study. Despite these awe-inspiring powers, however, there is a terrible price to pay. As the decades become centuries, many Vampires lose their minds, sliding inexorably into madness.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cha_mage	In Ulthuan, those who devote their lives to magic are treated with the highest respect and honour. Though each kingdom has its own magical traditions and methods of scholarship, Saphery is the realm most famed for its mages, and it is at the White Tower of Hoeth that Ulthuan's seat of magical learning can be found. There, the greatest collection of Mages, Loremasters and scholars in the world endeavour to perfect their mastery of the sorcerous arts. It is a place of wonders unbounded, where mages strive to harness every aspect of the Winds of Magic.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauder_berserkers	Marauder Berserkers are driven by one thing alone; a lethal intent to inflict unparalleled brutality upon their enemies. Like all Marauders, they are unrelenting combatants who habitually take what their own lands cannot provide from lesser men, but are set apart by their bizarre pre-battle rituals and unequalled fanaticism for killing. They immerse themselves in a psychotic state of mind before a fight, always consuming vast quantities of beer and indulging in head-butting contests prior to entering the battlefield. Once they see their enemies they attack without regard for their own lives, wild-eyed and frothing at the mouth. Upon reaching their target, the Berserker turns into a human whirlwind – with an axe in each hand, he spins, chops, and dismembers with a strength only achievable by a madman.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_cav_cold_one_knights_0	Cold One Knights count themselves amongst the finest warriors in Naggaroth. They are nobles of great wealth and ambition, whose warrior instincts elevate them far beyond the upstart cavalrymen of lesser races. Their weapons are the finest that can be bought in the great cities: long swords enchanted in such a manner as to never lose their edge, and tall lances sharp enough to pierce the hide of a Dragon. Their mounts, too, are superior to those of other lands; no horse, no matter how well-trained or carefully bred, could ever hope to match the savagery of a Naggarothi Cold One.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_witch_hunter	Judge, jury and executioner combined, a Witch Hunter will use any means necessary to burn out heresy from the heart of the Empire. Not a twinge of doubt softens the knife-sharp edges of a Witch Hunter's soul; his bleak existence allows no room for foibles such as compassion or mercy. Indeed, they are often feared even by the innocent, as it is said that a Witch Hunter would sooner raze an entire village to the ground then see a single worshipper of Chaos go free. And yet for all the heartlessness and cruelty of this dark brotherhood, the Empire needs men of this calibre - men who will put aside their own humanity in order to punish and destroy those who embrace dark sorcery or the temptation of Chaos. Such is a Witch Hunter's duty, and it is a burden lesser men would find impossible to bear.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_dwf_ancestor_ghost_summoned	Called forth by the Horn of the Ancestors, ready to once again slay the foes of the Karaz Ankor.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_grail_guardians	The Fay Enchantress is one of the most revered and respected figures in all of Bretonnia. As is fitting of someone who speaks with the voice of the Lady, she is accompanied at all times by a retinue of Knights who defend her to the death. These men, selected from the very best of the Grail Knights, are warriors par excellence, striking down the enemies of Bretonnia with shining blades of justice. Though rumours abound that the Fay Enchantress is none other than the Lady herself, and therefore requiring no earthly protectors, the Grail Guardians care not and defend their charge all the same.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_field_trebuchet	The Field Trebuchet is an essential piece of equipment when the Bretonnians engage in siege warfare, and smaller versions of these machines are sometimes deployed on the field of battle. Indeed, since the king himself commissioned a number to be built with which to defend Couronne, their popularity has increased. Still, Knights tend to put on a show of disdain towards siege engines - some refusing to use them at all. Nevertheless, it is a sign of particular opulence to be in possession of a Trebuchet, for they are time consuming to create and are individually hand-crafted. There are only a finite number within Bretonnia with the skill to create them, and their services are highly sought after. Although a Knight would never stoop so low as to operate a missile weapon himself, let alone a war machine, he could grudgingly see their strategic worth and allow his low-born servants to use them - for being peasants they don’t understand the concept of honour anyway!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_inf_saurus_warriors_blessed_1	When the Lizardmen march to battle, it is the Saurus who make up the hardened core of the fighting forces. This is no surprise, for the Saurus were created solely for the purpose of war and protection. The Old Ones cultivated this race of reptilian warriors, although whether they created them entirely, or raised them up from some primordial life form of the jungles, is not clear. What is assured, however, is their role and function. In the prehistory of the world, a time before the coming of Elves or Dwarfs, it was the Saurus who pacified the lands, fighting great battles and exterminating entire species in accordance with the Old Ones' plans. Although unable to master more complicated devices, Saurus use simple weapons to devastating effect - wielding obsidian-tipped spears and heavy clubs spiked with jagged stones. Using their great strength, Saurus can leave the roads and hack through the dense jungles of Lustria using brute force alone.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_emp_flagellants	The Empire is a dangerous and often cruel place. Wars, plagues and the predations of terrible monsters can destroy whole towns and force their inhabitants to become beggars, vagabonds and brigands. All who endure such hardships are hardened by their losses, yet some are driven over the edge of sanity by their suffering. Many of these dishevelled wretches see their plight as a morbid sign that the Empire is about to collapse, an irrefutable portent that these are the last, desperate days of a dying world. These men revel in their despair, despondent in all things yet manic in their pronouncements of doom. When battle is joined, bands of crazed Flagellants beat themselves into a frenzy before charging headlong towards the enemy. They throw themselves into the fray without hesitation, against the most hopeless of odds. With howls of doom on their lips and visions of martyrdom in their thoughts, Flagellants fight with wild ferocity, swinging their flails at their enemies and leaving trails of blood and woe in their wake. Heedless of danger or injury, these madmen will continue to fight with reckless abandon until each and every one of them lies dead or dying on the battlefield, thus vindicating their belief that the end is indeed nigh.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_manfred_von_carstein	While Vlad von Carstein was the most physically powerful of the Vampire Counts, Mannfred was the most cunning. When Vlad was slain, Mannfred did not involve himself in the infighting that would see Konrad rise to prominence. Instead, he travelled far and wide, seeking to deepen his knowledge of necromantic lore. He made an unholy pilgrimage to the ancient tombs of the Nehekhara and the ancient city of Lahmia, where he wrested the secrets of the Liche Priests from bone-dry papyrus and scrolls made from human skin. Mannfred also studied the ancient spells in the first of the Books of the Dead. Eventually, his journeys took him to Nagashizzar. None can say what foul bargains Mannfred made with that surreal realm's inhabitants in return for forbidden knowledge. When Mannfred finally returned to Sylvania, he was more powerful than ever, and took over the Undead legions in the wake of Konrad's destruction. Mannfred was almost as masterful as Vlad at concealing his true nature. As he sought for allies, Mannfred would travel abroad in the guise of an Imperial lord. He was always courteous to those he met on his travels, as befits a noble from a powerful family. When Mannfred revealed himself at the height of his power, his appearance was far more horrifying - his face became contorted and corpse-like, and his scalp writhed with magical energy. Yet his newfound powers were not enough. In the end, Mannfred was defeated and his army annihilated at the Battle of Hel Fenn. Some storytellers claim that Mannfred is not vanquished. They say he rode from Drakenhof against the forces of Chaos when they invaded the Empire. If Mannfred has survived, then surely he will reveal his designs for the Imperial throne.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_def_cha_crone	Crone Hellebron is the most ancient of the Hag Queens and second only to Morathi in Khaine's sight. However, while the youth and beauty of Morathi never fades, Hellebron's is now almost expended, for the Hag Sorceress deliberately withheld from her the deepest secrets needed to use the Cauldrons of Blood. Therefore, ever more sacrifices are needed to fill Hellebron's cauldron each year, and yet the rejuvenating effects last for a smaller length of time on each occasion. Ugly and worn as she may be, Hellebron remains the greatest of the Brides of Khaine. Her mastery of the many ways of murder eclipses even that of Morathi - who is often too distracted by her sorcerous pursuits - and far outstrips the skills of the other Hag Queens. It is she who leads the Lord of Murder's unholy rites and dictates the holy creed that all Witch Elves must follow. She is so steeped in the ways of death that her merest touch can kill, and a single whispered word from her withered lips can open up old wounds to bloody life. Wherever Hellebron treads, the gaze of Khaine follows.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_luthor_harkon	The region of the New World known as the Vampire Coast owes its name to Luthor Harkon, a Vampire of unknown origins who established a realm on the northeastern stretch of the Lustrian shoreline after becoming stranded there many years ago. As leader of a pirate fleet crewed by the dead and the damned, he holds sway over a sea region proven to be incredibly treacherous to unwary vessels, swelling his horde of Undead mariners with shipwrecked unfortunates. While on a fateful quest to augment his might, he attempted to use Dark Magic to enter ancient chambers sealed with powerful glyphs, which retaliated and started to drain his lifeforce. Luthor managed to break free but the damage had been done – his connection to the Winds of Magic was severed and his mind shattered, leaving his personality fractured into a dozen different facets battling for dominance. In the years since, the only common goal that Luthor’s various personalities have been able to work towards is that of finding a cure for his condition, seizing the Lizardmen's artefacts in the hope that their power can heal his damaged psyche.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_inf_tomb_guard	The Tomb Guard are the partially mummified remains of the king's elite guard. They are exceptional warriors, maintaining all the discipline and martial skill they had in life. In battle, the Tomb Guard form unwavering ranks of armoured warriors. They have spilled the blood of their enemies for countless centuries, and numerous armies have been dashed against their implacable shield wall. Although the Tomb Guard were rewarded with a form of mummification, the embalming rituals used were nowhere near as elaborate as the ceremonies that the Tomb Kings and Tomb Princes underwent. However, Tomb Guards have been reborn with immortal bodies far stronger and more resilient than the flesh and blood they had in life. Furthermore, Tomb Guards retain more of their former personalities than the massed soldiery of Skeleton Warriors. They awaken with memories of heroic deeds, bloody victories and the unyielding will to destroy their king's enemies still burning strongly in their mind. Above all they remember their duty to protect their Tomb King from harm, and any that threaten their charge are slain, cut down without pause.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_inf_chameleon_skinks_0	With skin able to mimic the patterns of their surrounding environment, Chameleon Skinks are able to sneak within a few arms' lengths of their enemies. From their ideal ambush position, the well-camouflaged Skinks will loose a hail of blowpipe darts, each tipped with the venomous secretions of a Lustrian tree frog. The poison is so virulent that it can even boil the foul blood in a Daemon's veins. Chameleon Skinks are exceptionally accurate, able to fire with unerring precision. They are aided by their large, protruding eyes which give them the means to focus on two different things independently, and to achieve all-around sight without moving their heads - a vital ability for a creature that stands completely still in order to blend in with its environment. Last, but not least, the Chameleon Skinks' eyes have a telescopic ability, enabling them to zoom their focus upon a target. Even heavily-armoured foes are not safe, as the Chameleon Skinks can aim at the more vulnerable joints or thread a shot straight through a miniscule helmet slit.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_war_mammoth	Very few beasts have suffered more terrifyingly apt mutations for the purposes of battle than the War Mammoth. Granting them extra tusks and a greater size, their affliction also causes them to be violently aggressive. The Northmen consider them sacred because they go where they will, and destroy what they will – living totems of might and power. Training such a tainted beast to be ridden in battle is not an easy undertaking, and in some cases has to be facilitated by secretive shamanic rituals. Once a War Mammoth is brought under control, warriors fight from its back atop a fortified wooden platform, or otherwise the creatures are made to carry the mighty war-altars of the Chaos Gods onto the battlefield, held aloft and inviolable for all below to see.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_fleet_captain	Fleet Captains are not only formidable fighters armed with the finest equipment aboard their vessels, but are also powerful Vampires who use dark forms of magic to hurt their enemies or regenerate their Undead minions. Like their Vampire Admiral counterparts, some trace their origins back to Sylvania or were once seafaring swashbucklers who now fight in service of the Undead. Although typically associated with a Vampire Admiral, Fleet Captains are subordinate to no-one and are driven by the same base instincts as all other Vampires. Their immortality means they have had extensive time to hone their skills, making them feared combatants. In the swirling melee of battle they are first into the fray, often seeking out opponents to duel in single combat. As mayhem rages all around, the clank of their cursed cutlasses chime out as they surge forward – after all, to a bloodthirsty Vampire, there is no surer way to cripple the morale of an opposing crew than to leave their master dead and bleeding.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_inf_white_lions_of_chrace_0	The White Lions have served as the personal guard of the Phoenix King since the time of Caledor the First. White Lion regiments are often despatched to join the armies of Ulthuan during times of particular danger, tasked with protecting High Elf generals and mages, or bolstering the overall  strength of the army. White Lions are renowned for their unflinching courage in the face of overwhelming odds and terrible horrors, protecting their charge whatever the foe and regardless of the danger to themselves.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_mon_great_eagle_summoned	The Great Eagles of Ulthuan have always been firm allies to the High Elves. The histories tell that the two races have fought in one another's cause since the time of the Daemon invasion, but legend carries the friendship deeper into the past. Indeed, in some tales, it was Talyn, King of the Eagles, who bore Ereth Khial away to the Underworld at Asuryan's command. Like the High Elves, Great Eagles are haughty creatures who long remember insults, and do not suffer foolish company gladly. When High Elf armies assemble, the noble Eagles too join the battle. They swoop down upon the crew of enemy war machines, tearing them apart with powerful talons before using mighty wings to glide swiftly away.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_emp_grey_wizard	The Grey Order is the most secretive of all the Colleges of Magic. Indeed, though its members refer to themselves as Grey Guardians, just who, or what, they might be guarding remains unknown to outsiders. The Grey Order studies spells of concealment and illusion, which do not lend themselves well to the favour or ordinary folk. They are sometimes called Trickster Wizards, though never to their faces. More commonly, they are referred to as Grey Wizards, named after the colour of their robes, hats and wild, wolfish beards. They are wanderers who are often employed to deliver vital messages across the Empire. What makes this so mysterious is that they seem to cover the vast distances involved almost invisibly and at impossible speed.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_pro01_unit_long_text_dwf_grombrindal	Grombrindal is an enigmatic figure, recorded throughout the Dwarfs' history, appearing to give aid to his bearded kin whenever they find themselves in a particularly dire and unfavourable situation. Just what can one Dwarf do when a Karak is besieged by thousands of Greenskins, or a Dwarf throng surrounded and outnumbered by a warherd of braying, ravenous Beastmen, however? In Grombrindal’s case, it turns out that he can do quite a lot; the White Dwarf is a mighty warrior, some say bettered only by Grimnir himself. Every slash of his legendary axe see the heads of urks tumble from their dishonourable shoulders.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_boar_boyz	Most Orc Boar Boyz mobs have colourful titles - "Da Tuskers", "Snortin' Wreckas", "Line-Smashas" and so on. Many bear crude board imagery on their banners and shields, depicting tusked skulls, bloody hoofs, and the like. When not carried in battle, such gear of war hangs atop the stockade pens that enclose the war boars. It is common practice to stack any trophies, like severed heads or enemy banners, around the boar enclosure. Boar Boyz take advantage of their elite status, lording it over all other Greenskins save leaders and Black Orcs. It is natural in some tribes for a mob of Boar Boyz to develop into Big 'Uns. The combination of especially large and powerful Orcs atop war boars makes for even more devastating charges and, not surprisingly, even greater swagger and bravado around the Greenskin camp.	true
