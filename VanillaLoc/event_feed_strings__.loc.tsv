"Revered master, we have returned!" said Yukannadoozat enthusiastically. Tar-gax growled. The Slann did not stir.

Even so, the Skink and Kroxigor approached their sleeping master with the appropriate respect.

"Lord Mazdamundi sends his..."

The Mage-Priest's eyes snapped open. Its hypnotic stare bored into Yuk's own eyes and a deep, endless hum flooded the chamber.

"The world is in peril," spoke the Slann, the words appearing directly in Yuk's head above the endless hum.

"Forgive me, master. But your timeline is not synched. We have just averted disaster – the Great Vortex is now in our possession."

"NO!" boomed the voice in the Skink's head. "A greater threat to this world arises. What has just occurred is but a small meal compared to the feast the Ancient Enemy has in store for us. N'kari comes and we must be ready."	true

event_feed_strings_text_wh2_event_feed_string_scripted_event_epilogue_secondary_detail_skv	Sneek Scratchett bit his tail until blood flowed between his teeth. It was his way of releasing the built up stress and nervous energy. He was under tremendous pressure, having risen from lowly scribe to herald of a living God. It was the highest status any mortal Skaven could possibly achieve and therefore he was the most hated. He'd already been the target of several assassination attempts.

Sneek entered his grand burrow. It was richly adorned - another status symbol, another reason all other Skaven envied and hated him. He stopped abruptly when he saw a great mirror stood against the roughly-burrowed wall. Sneek sniffed suspiciously at it. His bloody tail wafted to-and-fro in nervousness. Was this a gift? From one of the clans, to buy his favour?

He scuttled up to the mirror and checked behind it to make sure the void wasn't concealing an assassin. It wasn't. He looked again at the surface of the mirror, its green sheen revealing that it was made of polished Warpstone.

Then there was a hiss. Sneek's whiskers went straight in alarm.

"Litter-thing...," said the Screaming One from the mirror. The face of the Verminlord coalesced within it. "How quickly you-you have risen, little scribe," it said. "I see you have found my mirror. I'm glad my servants could deliver it-it." Sneek gulped. "You have enjoyed great riches thanks to the-the path I put you on. The secrets of those rituals I gave... there was always going to be a cost. Now we must talk about my price, yes-yes?"

Priest Nerutep was en route to the inner sanctum where his charge waited, but he lingered.

Arcane energy rippled down the walls and across the passage to form a barrier, but the Liche stepped through easily enough, giving a rasping hiss. It was trying to laugh.

“You don’t want me here do you?” whispered Nerutep to the pyramid. “Of course you don’t – a creation of Nagash, you know who I really am.”

A fierce wind blew along the corridor, but the Liche Priest walked on. “You can’t get rid of me that easily. You are linked to your creator are you not? Good. Tell Nagash – wherever he is – tell him Thutep walks within his sanctum. Yes, that will rile him. The lost King of Khemri influences the Black Pyramid now.”

A call came from down the corridor. His charge was getting impatient.

“Coming, sire,” said the Liche Priest - the second-born son and brother to Nagash strode more swiftly along the passageway.	true

event_feed_strings_text_wh2_dlc11_event_feed_string_scripted_pirate_ship_secondary_detail_1	Houghhoff was a renowned admiral in the imperial navy and his tale is one of bewilderment. The story tells that he kept a bright yellow parrot as a pet that sat upon his shoulder, never leaving his master’s side for a moment. Houghhoff, famous for having never lost a battle at sea, somewhat oddly put the credit for every victory solely with the parrot! Supposedly, during the heat of battle, the parrot squawked key tactical advice, which the admiral would use to soundly beat his opponents.

Whether Houghhoff’s parrot was simply uttering madness-induced ramblings or not, his crew could not deny the Reik-Admiral’s resultant mastery of naval combat. So, when one morning Houghhoff exited his cabin and announced to his crew that they were to leave the service of the Empire immediately and become pirates – upon the suggestion of the parrot – everyone aboard simply... agreed.	true
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_dlc11_event_feed_string_scripted_pirate_ship_secondary_detail_2	As a High Elf prince, Fhiron Wavemaker had lived a life of luxury, but – as is the case with many who want for nothing, materially-speaking – eventually began to feel empty and yearned for something more. One afternoon, along the coast of Saphery, he set sail into the mist of the Sea of Dreams in a small sailing boat with no other soul aboard. Upon returning many hours later, Fhiron rushed to the harbour of Port Elistor and had a large vessel commissioned, which some even said was a weapon of war.

Fhiron’s ship was completed many months later, upon which the prince immediately put together a crew of the most loyal from his court and set sail through the Straits of Lothern. Nobody knows what exactly caused him to give up everything and choose a life at sea, but whatever happened that one afternoon in the mist is undoubtedly where it all began…	true
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_dlc11_event_feed_string_scripted_pirate_ship_secondary_detail_3	A once-famous vintner from Bretonnia, Heastie was aboard his trade ship en route to deliver goods to the New World. Near to reaching their destination the ship was beset by an Undead vessel commanded by the legendary pirate Rozov von Drak. As the Unliving stormed Heastie’s ship, sparing not one of his crew, he made his last stand at the helm. Surrounded, and with swords to his throat, his enemy made an offer: join him as a Vampire in Undeath and serve as his first mate. Heastie, without much choice, all things considered, accepted Drak’s offer and so came to serve the Vampire for many years aboard his ship, learning not only the ways of piracy, but also those of Dark Magic.

Heastie always harboured his own grand plans for greatness, however. One night, as he stood with von Drak at the helm, Heastie drew his blade and lopped off his master’s head. He stood there as the Skeleton crew crumbled to piles of bones, before raising the lifeless husks once more to serve him. Now as captain of the ship, and with a crew of Undead, he began a reign of terror all his own!	true

"Why do you linger, Shadowblade? I thought Hellebron had summoned you back to Har Ganeth. My spies tell me she is not amused by your recent exploits." The Assassin said nothing but remained head down in submission. Malekith flexed his fingers as wisps of Vortex energy played up and down his armoured form. Although it was impossible to see his face behind the golden death mask, the Witch King was clearly amused.

"It's this you want, isn't it?" He produced Felicion's soul-casket, dangling it before Shadowblade in a taunting gesture.

"Yes."

"Very well." He tossed the soul-casket and Shadowblade plucked it from the air. He bowed and turned in one swift motion, but stopped when he heard the Witch King speak once more.

"A boon, Shadowblade, for your sister served me well. But if you must resurrect her, know that I will not entertain petty plots of revenge against me." The assassin gave a curt nod and strode away. "My mother on the other hand…," said the Witch King to the rapidly disappearing Assassin. He didn't raise his voice; he didn't have to. "She always needs to be kept in check."	true

"I've found her," he said. From behind him Tyrion strode; at first the prince looked longingly towards the Shrine of Khaine, and then quickly refocused on what his brother was scrutinising - the body of Galifreius... or was it?

"You are right, that is not my squire. When did you suspect?"

"It doesn't matter. But that's why the rat-swarm attacked her over Talarian. How typical of Skaven. They could smell the treachery," said Teclis.

"And what of my real squire? What became of her?"

"I'd postulate she was ambushed en route to meeting Talarian for the very first time."

"All this while we were taking advice from Malekith's puppet, and you knew!" raged Tyrion.

"I suspect she was Morathi's thrall actually," mused Teclis, ignoring his brother's anger. "And not ‘knew' but suspected."

"So what now, brother? I want vengeance for this outrage, and with the Vortex stabilised we have the breathing space to take it!"

Teclis glanced around at the harsh terrain. Even he felt the pull of Khaine - of rage and vengeance - for the God of Murder's shrine was uncomfortably close. He looked southwards.

"I will continue my labours in Lustria, there is still much to learn there," said the High Loremaster. Tyrion gave his brother a sour look.

"After all we've been through? When will you deign to return to Ulthuan?"

event_feed_strings_text_wh2_event_feed_string_scripted_event_epilogue_secondary_detail_cst_aranessa	The wind was in her favour and now she had a new pet! Captain Saltspite unleashed a rare laugh as the Swordfysh effortlessly glided through the waves. She was more than a mere pirate now, but a governess of many ports and richer than most Tilean princes. Maybe she should have shunned the living long ago?

It’s true that at first she had abhorred the Vampires and their zombie thralls on her ship, and only tolerated it due to the Seafather’s commandment. Yet, as they had slowly replaced the living and brought her victory after victory, Saltspite grew less concerned. Now she struggled to remember when she had last spoken to someone with breath and not seawater in their lungs.

Who needs friends when you have power? That is what her uncle had told her anyway… for, of late, Manann spoke to her less and less. But there was another who filled that void; this one spoke of storms and sharks, and glorified her as the ultimate predator. He would take care of his niece and together they would rule the waves.	true

If he were still living, he may have taken a deep breath, but those days of heartbeats and warm blood were long gone. Nevertheless, still cursed with a mortal’s desires, Noctilus could not hide his pleasure. Amanar was his; a gargantuan corpse enthused with Necromantic energy to wield against his foes.

He would continue to expand his network of coves and burgeoning empire outwards from the Galleon’s Graveyard, for there was still much power to be sought. Let the other fools battle for the Vortex, he would feed the skull-strewn Maelstrom with soul-power, and when it was ready, he would sail the Bloody Reaver into it. Then the Count could ply the seas of time, go anywhere or any-when; it was the ancestors of Jaego Roth who had the most to fear, for he would hunt them all down.

event_feed_strings_text_wh_event_feed_string_scripted_event_chaos_invasion_defeated_secondary_detail	As the last of the Chaos hordes is scoured from the face of the world, an awful silence descends. More than a silence; an absence of sound which echoes the all-consuming void without. All creation is stilled, breath held in anticipation of the final cataclysm.

Then, tentatively, gently, life reasserts itself. Not in a grand way to echo those who sought to end everything, but in the small ways which of themselves are life. Birdsong pierces the silence, hesitant at first, then swelling; a defiant hymn to creation, borne on a soft wind that sifts dust onto the scattered corpses littering the bloody plain of battle. And the spell is broken. Bloodied veterans, survivors, refugees - all draw breath into their aching lungs and weep at the taste and smell of victory, peace, and life.

Yet what is life if not the constant striving of one against the other? After all, every hedgerow is a bloody battleground, every plant a murderer, every creature red in tooth and claw. Even as the weak raise their eyes to a golden future, the wise are glancing about to see who will make the first move in seizing it for themselves. The shield of civilisation which turned aside the deadly thrust of Chaos is now a heavy and cumbersome thing. Those who are first to cast it aside will be quickest with their blades, and a knife in the back is surest of all. Comrades who stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the shield wall now step apart and take each other’s measure. Alliances begin to unravel and the storm clouds gather once more.	true

Yet now their precious Vortex quivers, Ulthuan shall sink and she will sing to the Phoenix King as he chokes on seawater!

Bathing in the adoration of her mindless, groaning crew, she was temporarily oblivious when a visitor appeared upon the deck of the Lamprey. It was a thing of rags, incorporeal and long-dead.

"Enchantress," it whispered in greeting with an unearthly hiss. Cylostra flexed her flabellum to hide her face.

"Who addresses Madame-Captain Direfin?" she asked in her most self-important voice. 

"I come at the behest of my master," said the ghostly emissary. "He asks if you desire a return to Bretonnia? Where he has been working against the living for some time and could use a spirit of such prodigious talent."

The Madame-Captain inspected her silvery form in the mirror as she considered a response.

"A patron," she mused. "And who is it that shows such interest in moi?"

"Like you, mistress, he is an Enchanter, and a great one no less. He has gone under many names over the centuries. At this time, he is only known as 'The Nameless'."	true

The power of the books of Nagash, now gathered and harnessed, has streamed into the pyramid, detaching it from its foundations and lifting it up from the sand dunes below. Surely it is clear for all to see that this is the grand design of the fabled Necromancer who’s name this massive structure bears, and perhaps through unparalleled foresight or through coincidence alone the power emanating from every crevice and block of stone acts as a beacon to all across Nehekhara. Undoubtedly any king or queen with the ability to affect the outcome of this plight will muster their forces and head towards this monument suspended in the sky… only time will tell if this is indeed Nagash’s will manifesting itself.	true

The Crow has seen the world gripped by a plague like no other, destined to sweep through the settlements of all races, as merciless and destructive as any army of Chaos.

Those inflicted by this pestilence begin convulsing almost immediately, their soon-to-be lifeless corpses nothing but Chaos-ridden husks of what once was. As the blackened and disfigured bodies clog the streets, those lucky enough to escape the plague's grasp can only flee.

Attempts to cure or even inoculate against the pestilence are vain hopes that can do more but delay an inevitable demise. Even the finest doctors are powerless to act against the Crow's ire. Your allegiance, however, has made your people and troops immune to its wrath.

The broken corpses littering the battlefield lie motionless, their futile struggles over. Death is the only victor here.

The stillness is broken. A chill wind rises, heavy with the taint of the eternal tomb, blows upon the tatters of once-proud banners now trampled into the mud, and the feathers of the carrion birds as they gorge upon the fallen.

Such is the way of the world. Great Lords, arrogant in the strength of their arms, vie with each other for dominance, oblivious to the fact that death, patient and inexorable, waits for all living things. Even as many raise their eyes to a golden future, there are those who wish to make the first move and seize it for themselves. The shield of civilisation, which turned aside the deadly thrust of Chaos, is now a heavy and cumbersome thing. Those who cast it aside first will be quickest with their blades - a knife in the back being the surest of all. Comrades who stood shoulder to shoulder on the field of battle now step apart and take each other’s measure. Alliances begin to unravel and the storm clouds gather once more.	true

Unable to remain in this world for long, the Horned One gifted his children the Pillar of Thirteen on which were scratched runes commanding that the Skaven cease their endless feuding and instead work together toward a great scheme. This scheme was to disrupt the power of the Great Vortex, using it to create a hole between dimensions, through which the Great Horned Rat could enter this world.

A Lord of Change, servant of the Chaos God Tzeentch, has emerged to challenge Archaon’s position as the Everchosen!

How like Tzeentch this is! Not for nothing is he known as the Great Deceiver, the Changer of Ways. Ever does he seek to guide mortals along paths destined to increase his own power, showing favour to those who use cunning or influence to manipulate and control the world, and watching in delight as his conspiracies unfold. The Master of Subtlety, his plots are infinitely complex and interwoven. He is the principal architect of secret alliances between his brother Gods, and also the Lord of the Grand Betrayal.

Through his servant, he has guided your advancement, watching and waiting until the moment is ripe to make his own move and sweep the board clear. The Lord of Change is his pawn, with whom Tzeentch will chastise the Everchosen, thus giving the Great Deceiver pre-eminence over the other Dark Gods.

As the wearer of the Crown of Domination, anointed by all the Gods of Chaos, Archaon must withstand the Lord of Change’s onslaught and fulfil his destiny as Lord of the End Times!	true

He was within the sanctum of Nagash, at the heart of the Black Pyramid. It hung in the sky, defying the gods and now the Liche King would use its power to resurrect his master, like any good servant.

“Ustab-Djaf, ey Shyish…,” spoke Arkhan in ancient Nehekharan before switching to the common tongue. “I command the God of Death to unfetter his most prominent prisoner; by Shyish, I invoke N–”

“Nagash?” said the voice of a Daemon. “No, my little Mortarch, our names are similar, but he is elsewhere. I am N'kari, and you are playing my game,” it said with a voice both beautiful and horrific.

“What!” demanded Arkhan, scanning the sanctum for the source of the voice.

“Calm yourself, Liche,” it said, amused. “I care not for your schemes. Play your game, build your petty empire, but know that I am now in your world, and will soon be ready to play…”
