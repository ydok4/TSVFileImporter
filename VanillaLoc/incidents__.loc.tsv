incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_monster_hunt_9_stage_2	While the slavers of the Point are some of the meanest and cruellest men upon Lustria's coast, even they pale to the  mighty Norse Chieftains. The merchants grovel at your feet, desperate to appease you and your retinue out of a pathetic fear of what will happen if they earn your displeasure. Gold is given as tribute.

At first they draw a blank on a willing guide - they are coast-huggers who rarely venture into the jungle interior. Then, one of the slave-masters dares make a suggestion. He leads you to a cage, in which a small reptile with a blue crest hisses defiantly. The locals call it a Skink and claim that with the right amount of 'persuasion' it will lead you to your quarry.	true
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_monster_hunt_8_stage_2	The Dark Elf merchant is suspiciously pleased to receive the Norse, venturing that he will be a willing buyer should they retrieve the corpse of the 'Mother of the Flame'. He points to the extinguished pinion that is sat upon a dais guarded by two Druchii warriors. He cautions that this will be no easy hunt. Legend has it, the Phoenix is a creature of Hekarti, existing between the mortal plane and in the Realm of Chaos. It only makes its appearance on the side of the mortal veil rarely, once a century at most. It is 'awoken' into this world through the heart of a burning volcano.

According to the Dark Elf, that is the time to strike. They are vulnerable during those early moments of awakening, but will quickly gain strength and become deadly and all but impervious to attack.	true
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_skaven_ambush_2_a	By their very nature, Skaven love to talk, so you manage to keep them busy until your scouts return. As they ride into the clearing the Skaven are surprised and panic, turn their tails and run away!	true

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_skaven_ambush_1_b	Sometimes there's no way out but to reach for your purse. You begrudgingly pay the creatures and leave with your life intact, if not your dignity.	true
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_skaven_ambush_2_b	Skaven are not the best conversationalists and you soon run out of things to say. You stall for as long as you can, but the scouting party never returns. Your only option is to pay the Skaven if you wish to live.	true

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_flooded_armoury_2_a	The armour is far too large and cumbersome to carry out of the flooded chamber without specialised equipment. However, whilst inspecting it, your men find a most interesting item.	true
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_flooded_armoury_3_a	The armour is indeed the work of a master armourer, and it's surprisingly light too. Your retainers have no problems recovering it from the flooded vault.	true

Bloody excess and wanton slaughter flood the boulevards and plazas, all under Hellebron’s intense gaze - tonight is Death Night!

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_incident_neo_encounter_at_sea_3_b	You are no fool – you'd heard such songs before – they were clearly the work of Syreens, the hated Banshees of the sea. You later sent in a smaller expedition to extract whatever wealth could be found, but only a few of them returned after being attacked by a large mob of Zombie pirates.

The Empire troops started to unload items back onto their ship, but before you could order an interception, they were suddenly engulfed by a large, sulphurous explosion. The pirate shipwreck, now in a million pieces, was booby-trapped! You gathered what paltry bits of loot you could find floating nearby and hastily left the area.	true
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_incident_neo_encounter_at_sea_3_c	Deciding to first find out more about the island, you ordered your ship to drop anchor. When you eventually sent a small salvage party into the island a few days later, they were quickly attacked and almost wiped out by a large mob of Zombie pirates.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_incident_neo_encounter_at_sea_1_a	You waited for the rival salvagers to leave, after which you sent your crew in to take a closer look at the sea beast’s remains.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_incident_neo_encounter_at_sea_2_a	Having decided to wait to discover the fate of the convoy’s wreckage, you eventually receive word that several deadly sea battles took place at the site. Allegedly, very few ships managed to get in and out of the area with anything of any value without being set upon by murderous rivals. In the ensuing chaos, most of the loot ended up at the bottom of the ocean, but your scouts in the area still managed to recover a few valuables from the site. 	true

incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc02_incident_all_magic_carnage	The world yields to those who master the Winds of Magic. Great bolts from the heavens scour souls from bodies, whilst raging torrents of fire rend the very flesh from bone. Magic can rip enemies into a dozen pieces or leave nothing but an ugly bloodstain where once they stood. The power granted by the cataclysm, many eons ago, can be harnessed now to bring ruin and destruction upon our enemies. All those who feel the pull of Magic feel it grow as the world festers under Chaos’ Ruinous gaze; their need to ravage grows stronger and stronger by the hour.	true
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_lone_wanderer_2_b	You have made a mistake... the stranger is a skilful fighter who wounds you before slipping away into the night.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_incident_epilogue_cst_cylostra	All the world is a stage and Cylostra had given her ultimate performance. Her prize, the Merwyrm of the High Elves, Amanar. Good! They stole her life, so she took from them Lothern’s guardian. Yet now their precious Vortex quivers, Ulthuan shall sink and she will sing to the Phoenix King as he chokes on seawater!

Bathing in the adoration of her mindless, groaning crew, she was temporarily oblivious when a visitor appeared upon the deck of the Lamprey. It was a thing of rags, incorporeal and long-dead.

"Enchantress," it whispered in greeting with an unearthly hiss. Cylostra flexed her flabellum to hide her face.

"Who addresses Madame-Captain Direfin?" she asked in her most self-important voice. 

"I come at the behest of my master," said the ghostly emissary. "He asks if you desire a return to Bretonnia? Where he has been working against the living for some time and could use a spirit of such prodigious talent."

The Madame-Captain inspected her silvery form in the mirror as she considered a response.

"A patron," she mused. "And who is it that shows such interest in moi?"

"Like you, mistress, he is an Enchanter, and a great one no less. He has gone under many names over the centuries. At this time, he is only known as 'The Nameless'."	true

Captain Saltspite unleashed a rare laugh as the Swordfysh effortlessly glided through the waves. She was more than a mere pirate now, but a governess of many ports and richer than most Tilean princes. Maybe she should have shunned the living long ago?

It’s true that at first she had abhorred the Vampires and their zombie thralls on her ship, and only tolerated it due to the Seafather’s commandment. Yet, as they had slowly replaced the living and brought her victory after victory, Saltspite grew less concerned. Now she struggled to remember when she had last spoken to someone with breath and not seawater in their lungs.

Who needs friends when you have power? That is what her uncle had told her anyway… for, of late, Manann spoke to her less and less. But there was another who filled that void; this one spoke of storms and sharks, and glorified her as the ultimate predator. He would take care of his niece and together they would rule the waves.	true

A band of Lizardmen is locked in mortal combat with a host of crypt-horrors, and they are losing. As the Undead begin to overwhelm the reptiles, the agent spots a standard-bearer scurrying for the entrance with a clanking sack of relics on his back. He slays the creature and takes the trove. Surveying the limits of the chamber, he also realises that Alcadizaar's sarcophagus is missing. Hefting the sack, he exits the tomb and sets out to rendezvous with Arkhan.	true

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_arkhan_the_tomb_blade_of_arkhan_stage_3b	The agent hovers at the entrance until the clamour dies down, then steals inside to witness a scene of devastation. Lizardmen corpses litter the main chamber, but the Crypt Horrors have returned to their swaying, quiescent state. Sensing some kinship with the agent perhaps, they do not attack, but point mournfully toward an alcove where clearly a fine sarcophagus once lay. Alcadizaar's coffin has been spirited away. Tearing a symbol from the tunic of a dead Lizardman, your agent sets out to bring Arkhan the news. 

 Arkhan is beside himself with anger. What could the perfidious Lizardmen want with Alcadizaar's remains? He smells some species of dark scheme afoot, and demands the Liche Priests bring him news of these interlopers. Through divine communion, the Scavenger-God Ualatp reveals to them the location of the looters. Arkhan wastes no time, and sets out with his army to wrest Alcadizaar's remains from the Lizardmen.	true

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_negative_2a	There is a constant fear that anyone in Ulthuan could be one of the Witch King’s agents in deep cover.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_negative_2b	To accuse {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} of worshipping the gods of the underworld is a serious charge.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_skv_positive_3a	Manipulating a minor ratmen clan is not hard; through various factors, often in disguise as Druchii, we can have the Skaven as our puppets, sending them as neutral ambassadors: first to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} then to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}.

While a foreign dignitary was visiting, rumours started circulating that the noble was ridiculing the foreign delegation behind their backs and even hired a few jesters to give a private performance to mock them. Of course the noble denied it, but a few days later, a letter addressed to his wife surfaced, in which he expressed his disdain for the foreign dignitary.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_positive_1d	Business at the Phoenix Court rarely happens while the king attends and deals with matters of state. It is when the Princes and Nobles splinter off to the alcoves and form informal sub-committees that things get done and so, over a few cups of wine, the binding of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} can begin.	true
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_def_positive_1a	To flatter and bribe is to ensure favour… delivering a gift of slaves to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} is regrettable for the captives, but if we frame this as {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}’s generosity it will strengthen the bond between these two factions, and be advantageous for us.	true
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_positive_1a	A careful discussion here, a subtle word over wine there, a smile that lingers, an eyebrow raised over a jest - all things men and Dwarfs would never pick up on.

incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc02_incident_all_weapon_carnage	Battle is a blood-soaked affair. Limbs severed, bones exposed; men left for dead in the cruor-soaked fields amongst scores of fallen friends and enemies. Strong weapons, forged with time, sweat and expertise, mark the difference between victory and defeat. A good sword cuts clean through bone, severing heads and limbs, where lesser weapons will merely maim. As instability grows across the world, so too does man’s bloodlust and his desire for war and carnage on an ever-grander scale.	true
incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_4_stage_3_2_mpc	The Greenskins are famous for having all manner of monstrosities in their despicable ranks, including the lumbering Giants that follow them to feast in battle. Having heard of one very belligerent Giant called Blorgar the Mad Titan terrorising the Grey Mountains, you set out to slay the leviathan for a great sacrifice, for what can be more impressive than bringing down a legendary descendant of the long-forgotten Sky-Titans?

Once you’d arrived in the Grey Mountains, however, Blorgar was nowhere to be seen. The only chance of gaining any useful information of the Giant’s whereabouts lay with a Bretonnian herb collector who’d allegedly stumbled upon an underground lair while spelunking nearby. Unfortunately this Bretonnian had been taken hostage by some nasty Goblins on a recent raid. The importance of the information known to him is crucial to complete the hunt, so a Hero was sent into the gobboes' camp to steal him back.

Your servant dumps the hog-tied Bretonnian herb collector at your feet, along with some loot he managed to steal on his way out.	true
