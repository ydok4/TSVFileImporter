dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_def_names_of_power_co_4_teacher	Hailing from a distant land, a famed warrior comes, offering to teach his fearsome combat skills to your armies. After you accept his proposition, the warrior explains the lessons. Which, he asks, do you wish to learn?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_crumbling_buildings	In cities as old as the deserts it is the natural order that even the finest buildings eventually crumble and fall. One of our largest temples has started to collapse and we fear that it will soon topple, bringing down calamity. Should we reinforce it?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_def_names_of_power_ar_2_caravan	Whilst travelling a dangerous and treacherous road, your entourage is set upon by a horde of Beastmen. You believe you can fight them off, but there are options; either charge into the fight with the Cold Ones at your side, or slip away to safety and pick off their leader from the shadows...	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_whispers_of_the_mourning_chorus	One of the princes of Tiranoc has perished whilst hunting. He was a forthright and well-liked fellow, yet known for his streaks of arrogance and foolhardiness. His death is a terrible loss to the Tiranoc nobility, who hold themselves rigid with the starch of past glory. The Phoenix King and Everqueen are, of course, invited to attend the burial rites, yet how they participate is discussed with much fervour amongst the court.	true

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc08_confederate_wh_main_nor_bjornling	The leader of the Bjornling tribe has been defeated; a once powerful warlord now reduced to obscurity beneath your might. For as you stand tall in victory he kneels at your side, hands in chains, his followers stood amongst yours, brought to a halt in anticipation of your next utterance. His men now see him as weak and unfit to lead any longer, this is a chance for you to take control of this faction's forces and land, as well as its followers' dubious loyalty.

Though, while the allure of land may appear to make this choice a simple one, do not let the challenges that a larger empire creates escape you - perhaps simply killing this man and letting whatever is left of his faction fade into memory may be a more fitting end...	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_loyalty_skv_shades_of_grey_1	A robed figure approaches you, Lord! His face is obscured by a moulding hood, but a grey and ragged muzzle protrudes… it is an accursed Grey Seer! The Council, in their arrogance, of course, ask - no, demand - payment towards the realisation of plans yet unexplained. This one has come to collect...	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_children_of_eternity	The Asrai have long had a… patchy relationship with the denizens of the forest. Whilst often the two peoples get along harmoniously, there have been issues. Lately, malevolent Dryads have taken to kidnapping Elven children for fun. When brought to justice they remain unrepentant - it is their forest, they say. To burn them would anger the forest, but surely they must be made to pay for their crimes against the Asrai?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_encounter_at_sea_4	Clearly, two ships met in combat and brought each other low, their rival crews drowning in battle and hatred.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc08_confederate_wh_dlc08_nor_wintertooth	The leader of Wintertooth, Throgg, has been defeated; the King of the Trolls brought low at last. His followers look on in horror, their unwavering belief in their leader dashed in an instant, even this legend cannot deny your supremecy amongst all Norscans now. Surely now is the time to seize control, bring his domain into yours, take all that was once his. Or, you may free him... as an insult perhaps, an unending torment for this foe - the choice is yours.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_great_vortex_tmb_settra_the_crown_of_nehekhara_stage_3	The raid was a success. A barbarian chief, draped in ancient gold and gem-studded trinkets, is dragged before Settra. He is larger by far than the average human and wears a growling mask of surliness, but Settra revels in the terror that lurks behind his eyes. The creature's soul is forfeit, of course; Phakth demands eternal justice, and Settra his due. What will be the manner of this insect's passing?	true

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_new_blood	The signs are clear. The eternal war once again swerves in Lustria's direction; those that threaten to unmake the progress of the Great Plan gain power and prominence. Their designs must be countered. Do you wish to swell the warriors' ranks or bring forth a Saurus or Skink Hero to coldly annihilate the foe by fair means or foul?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_the_banisher	We have made a great discovery! During the course of our excavations, remains of the army that once served Alcadizaar the Conqueror, the last and maybe the greatest of all the Priest Kings of Nehekhara, have been unearthed. It would take but a little magic to raise them to our service, should we do so or give them a ritual burial in the classical Nehekharan style?	true

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_out_or_in	Word comes of a new Norscan incursion; those foul servants of the Ancient Enemy, who revel in barbarism, have gained a foothold in Lustria and must be cast out! Their small coastal encampment could be easily eradicated, but many of your number are about to leave in search of a plaque of paramount import. As such, will you commit your forces to destroy the warmbloods or recover the relic and learn of the Old Ones' sacred intentions?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_the_greater_good	Skinks have uncovered a fell lode that has the stench of Clan Pestilens about it. Plague strikes down all who go near it; many useful artisan Skinks have already been lost, and more are at risk. Quarantine would stop this malady in its foul tracks and frustrate the designs of the insidious Plaguelords, but the trapped artisans would be lost to the Great Plan for now. Alternatively, you could evacuate your Skinks to safety, a course which keeps their numbers high but risks the pestilence spreading elsewhere.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_main_dwf_a_grudge_too_far	The enemy has wronged us… but righting this grudge will cost us deeply, perhaps too deeply. Maybe, just this once, we should ignore the slight and focus on the grander objective?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_the_dreaming_wood	A young Glade Lord, full of hope and naivety, wishes to journey into the Dreaming Wood to recover a lost artefact. Headstrong and confident, perhaps to the point of arrogance; the Dreaming Wood is a twisted domain ruled by the Prince of Pleasure, Slaanesh - to enter is to dance with the Chaos God of madness and desire. Most who enter never return, claimed body and soul by the forces of Ruin. Yet this Glade Lord seems self-assured - do you allow them to recover this item or forbid the journey?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc08_nor_archaon_choice	The scars you rend deep in the lands and to their peoples and tribes has caught the attention of not just your fell Gods, but one who serves them above all others.
The Everchosen has deigned to summon you forth. He has use for such a warlord, and ‘requests’ you fight at his side in the war to come. Your armies shall march with his legions as he ravages the southern realms - the rewards will be great... And yet, such destruction will be in his name. Forging your own bloody path is surely the quickest way to Daemonhood? Even if it risks the wrath of Archaon.	true

dilemmas_localised_description_wh_pro01_dwf_grombrindal_god_choice_white_dwarf_15	Such is the age and renown of the White Dwarf that many sagas say he strode with the Ancestor gods themselves. It is a claim the White Dwarf does not refute - and no one dares challenge - for to doubt Grombrindal's word, or call him false, would surely end badly for the accuser...	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_heavens_or_the_underworld	The Asrai wish to erect a new shrine within Athel Loren, to give praise to the gods they so faithfully serve. Yet the question is posed - to whom should this shrine be dedicated? The two frontrunners are Asuryan or Khaine, yet ultimately the choice is yours. Do you wish honour the Phoenix King, Asuryan, the wise and just ruler of the Elven pantheon, or his brother Khaine; harsh and ruthless God of Battle?	true

dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc08_nor_prove_their_worth	During an attack on a rival village some of those defending it are awed by the mighty prowess of your warriors. They show some skill of their own, and ask to join your forces. But they are healthy and fit enough to make good slaves, too.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_0_stage_2	The weather around the Tower of Khrakk is even more inhospitable than first thought. This unusually harsh climate is seemingly unbearable for most things to dwell in too long. The tundra is devoid of life, which may also be evidence that the mighty Frigustrex is nearby, usurping all other predators in the vicinity. Further reconnaissance is needed, but if you are to dwell in the extreme weather you require the help of those who are most at home in this harsh, snowy habitat. Who will you choose to serve you for this task?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_2_stage_2	After days of searching, an enticing lead is uncovered. A slave languishing in a thrall pen up in the Goromadny Mountains is found repetitively mumbling stories about a ruthless and powerful Shaggoth with frightening power. Although clearly gone insane, it is plain to see that the pitiful man has experienced a terrible encounter in battle, missing an eye and an arm. But most importantly, he bears a tattoo known to be the mark of the fallen tribe.

The slave may be able to help you find your bounty, but his owner is asking an extortionate price for what is otherwise a useless, broken man. You could either pay the very dear price to buy the slave, or instead, pillage the entire enclave and take ownership of him and his owner by force!	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_4_stage_2	As you pillage Bretonnian lands you find out that the herb collector you seek had been there, but had recently been taken hostage by some Goblins on a raid. These nasty Goblins are still nearby, but if you were to approach them with your entire army, the spineless green fools might do what they do best – scurry away and hide – and the hostage may be lost. A different approach is needed, and one which doesn’t involve violence. You can either send messengers to attempt to buy the man from the Goblins on your behalf, or you could try a sneaky snatch-and-grab rescue attempt. Which do you choose?	true

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_loyalty_positive_def_wrongly_accused	Naggarothi politics are devious and deadly.

Despite the efforts of your enemies, your will has prevailed and the Great Vortex has been disrupted! Your triumph has ensured that your plans have come to full fruition. Bathe in glory, even as your enemies cower. Hail to the victor!

You may now choose to begin a new campaign, perhaps with a new race and in a different part of the world. However, if you desire you may continue conquering and ruling your empire. Although the Vortex is no longer a factor, the war goes on. There are still rivals to quell, lands to invade and a victory of total domination to strive for, and the fruits of your triumph over the Great Vortex will aid you in this. Leave or stay - the choice is yours...	true

But how best to display such power? Through a bloody massacre or the tempting of Dark Magic and the promise to share?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_great_naval_battle	A major naval battle has ended, leavin' hundreds dead on each side. Death is no barrier to continued service, as well you know - those who fell in battle would make fine new recruits.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_4_a	Pirate coves are some of the world’s most elusive places, where the wealth of local sea brigands is secretly kept and fiercely defended. It seems that today may be your lucky day, as your lookout in the crow’s nest claims to have spotted one – a small island cave, next to which a black ship is moored. The ship belongs to an infamous fleet of Vampire pirates, and it appears that there are Zombie Deckhands transferring treasure chests onto the ship right now. It’s an opportunity for a big payday, but these Unliving sea-dogs certainly won’t give up their wealth too easily.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_1_c	With a gush of putrid water, the bloated corpse of an ancient sea leviathan surfaces close by. You consider sending your crew to investigate what secrets the cadaver of the sea beast will bestow, but such an expedition is not without risk.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_great_vortex_cst_cylostra_the_bordeleaux_flabellum_stage_4	A self-obsessed singer needs a doting audience, and Cylostra is well aware that it is the Bretonnians who appreciate her talents the most. After all, it was a Bretonnian king who once favoured her above all other court singers, frequently inviting the diva to give private performances and serenade eminent guests at important stately banquets.

On the other hand, Cylostra is technically still well overdue for a high-profile performance before the High Elves of Ulthuan. Many years ago, when the Lamprey succumbed to a storm in the Eastern Straits of the Great Ocean, before Cylostra’s transformation, she was on an important diplomatic voyage to sing before the Phoenix King. A treaty of great import was reliant on his pleasure in her performance, for the Elves believe good art – music in particular – to be as valuable as gems and gold. It was an important engagement, so surely the High Elves will still be waiting for her?!

To find an audience, Cylostra could head east from the islands of Northern Yvresse towards Bretonnia, retracing the fateful voyage which led to her transforming into the eternally-vengeful spirit she has become. Alternatively, she could head towards the southern end of the Shifting Isles, where the High Elves' Old World shipping lanes are located, following them directly into the great Elven port of Lothern and, hopefully, to the Phoenix King himself...	true

After all, it was a Bretonnian king who once favoured her above all other court singers, frequently inviting the diva to give private performances and serenade eminent guests at important stately banquets.

On the other hand, Cylostra is technically still well overdue for a high-profile performance before the High Elves of Ulthuan. Many years ago, when the Lamprey succumbed to a storm in the Eastern Straits of the Great Ocean, before Cylostra’s transformation, she was on an important diplomatic voyage to sing before the Phoenix King. A treaty of great import was reliant on his pleasure in her performance, for the Elves believe good art – music in particular – to be as valuable as gems and gold. It was an important engagement, so surely the High Elves will still be waiting for her?!

To find an audience, Cylostra could head east from the islands of Northern Yvresse towards Bretonnia, retracing the fateful voyage which led to her transforming into the eternally-vengeful spirit she has become. Alternatively, she could head towards the southern end of the Shifting Isles, where the High Elves' Old World shipping lanes are located, following them directly into the great Elven port of Lothern and, hopefully, to the Phoenix King himself...	true

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_in_fighting	A dispute has developed between the nobles of Saphery and Yvresse, whom the Sapherian Elves call the 'ghosts of glory'. Although the petty, clandestine squabbles of lower houses are never usually a concern for the Phoenix King, the Sapherian Elves bristle with magical power, whilst Tor Yvresse is one of the most defensible, if dangerously ill-garrisoned, cities in Ulthuan. Harmony between these two houses is preferable but, if not possible, then someone, somewhere must be appeased.	true
