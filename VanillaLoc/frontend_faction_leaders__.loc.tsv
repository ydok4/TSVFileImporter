frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_vor_tmb_arkhan	In the Land of the Dead, no name is more hated than Nagash the Arch-Necromancer, architect of Nehekhara’s downfall. It was he that cast a great ritual and brought all the dead back to Unlife ahead of the promised Day of Awakening. Centuries before this epochal moment, he had ruled Khemri, stealing the kingship from his younger brother.

Arkhan was the most loyal of Nagash’s followers, pivotal in the coup that brought the nascent Necromancer to power. After his lord, Arkhan was the first to imbibe the Elixir of Life, thereby transitioning from mere mortal to Unliving immortal. For decades, Arkhan remained staunchly loyal to Nagash; a great warrior and general, he was also an accomplished student of dark sorcery thanks to his master's teachings. After fifty years of rule, the other cities of Nehekhara revolted against Nagash – desperate to end his malicious reign. The Army of the Seven Kings besieged Khemri, and Nagash was forced to retreat. Arkhan held back the allied Priest Kings’ legions through feats both martial and arcane. He finally fell, not to some hero’s blade but an ordinary spear thrown by a nameless soldier. By his dying breath he cursed both the spear and any that desecrated his corpse.

Nagash has returned to enact vengeance on Nehekhara several times over the centuries. One of the Arch-Necromancer's first acts was to resurrect his faithful lieutenant. And so Arkhan the Black, the Liche King, rose from the dead, as loyal as always and a key figure in Nagash’s many machinations. In an age of comets and new empires, Nagash remains adrift from the world… for the moment. But he is very much active. Arkhan's Black Tower a beacon for those who worship the Arch-Necromancer as a god-in-waiting. Naturally, his greatest rival – everyone's greatest rival no less – is Settra the Imperishable. The two have fought dozens of times; although Arkhan’s forces cannot rival Settra’s legions, neither can the Imperishable overcome the Liche King’s dark sorcery. Thus, their wars end in stalemate, and only when Arkhan utters false promises of fealty does Settra return satisfied to Khemri. Such false servitude cannot – will not – last, for while there is still a chance to resurrect Nagash, his loyal servant will take it.	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_vor_tmb_settra	In the land of Nehekhara, Khemri was the greatest city, ruled over by a dynasty of cruel kings and tyrants. While Nagash’s stolen rule of Khemri is indeed noteworthy, none – apart from the Arch-Necromancer himself – can question that its utmost reign came under High King Settra.

Before the wind of death ravaged Nehekhara, it was an impressive civilisation, a burgeoning realm of rival fiefdoms that saw mankind expand long before Sigmar was even born. But the curse of man, compared to Dwarfs and Elves, is their fleeting existence. Soon the kings and princes of the city-states became obsessed with death, with extending their meagre span. The Mortuary Cult was formed during Settra’s reign and charged with ensuring that mortal bonds would not halt his rule. Settra passed with a curse upon his lips, buried in a grand chamber beneath his mighty pyramid to await the Day of Awakening, when the Mortuary Cult will fulfil their promise and Settra will rise to rule Khemri and dominate all the kingdoms along the Great River Vitae once again. Only modest progress in extending life was made until the rise of Nagash, for it was he who was destined to become the first and greatest of all Necromancers – he who truly brought Unlife to the world.

The tale of Nagash is terrible to behold; needless to say, he was banished from Khemri – and thought destroyed – but many years later rose again and enacted his revenge on all Nehekhara. He cast a great ritual and all the dead in the city-states rose from their ageless slumbers. But this was not the glorious Day of Awakening promised by the Mortuary Cult. The kings awoke entombed in their sarcophagi, breaking free of their burial chambers they saw through empty eye sockets. They had not woken as gods, but were still the rotting mummies that had withered inside their tombs for countless centuries. Some went insane, others remain in denial, but a few were filled with rage at this betrayal. None more so than Settra.

Now Settra the Imperishable rules Khemri once more. His Undead legions march at his whim; the King of Kings will not rest until all are under his dominance, be they other, petty Tomb Kings, or the living, whom he despises, for they have something he can never again possess.	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_political_party_hef_alith_anar	Legend has it that, when Malekith fled into the west, the folk of Nagarythe chose Alith Anar as their ruler. The new king was the last heir of a great line, his forebears slain by the Witch King’s minions. In those days there were many Dark Elves still hiding in Ulthuan, and Alith Anar took to eradicating them with a vengeance. Foes not killed in battle were crucified on trees or had their skin stretched across the ragged cliff-faces, where those who passed could witness the insurgents' grisly fate. As Anar attacked and burned each enemy encampment, his infamy grew. He and his loyal warriors struck from the darkness to purge their homeland of traitors and those sympathetic to Malekith. And so the Legend of the Shadow King grew. 

To this day, Anar carries a bleak outlook, one which matches the lands over which he reigns, as the Shadowlands, Nagarythe, are dark and desolate places. Nagarythe's jagged coast still bears the scars of the Sundering, yet it is seen as home by the tough, seasoned Shadow Warriors who look upon their kin in the other nine kingdoms with nothing short of utter disdain.

Anar himself is a king without a palace, not that he desires a luxurious throne. One of the greatest Elven palaces of all, Anlec, was once capital of Nagarythe and the seat of the first Phoenix king. Now, it lies in ruins, but there have been many attempts by the Druchii and even some Asur to bring it back to past glories. The Shadow King, however, is more comfortable with his warriors in the wilds or even ranging beyond Nagarythe’s borders, to fulfil his eternal quest for vengeance against the traitor-kin who ruined his homeland and slaughtered his bloodline!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_main_political_party_dwarf_ungrim	The tale of Ungrim’s family is full of woe, as those in the Clan of Royal blood bear a history of calamities. Many years ago, King Barador, Ungrim’s five-time great-grandsire, suffered a terrible loss which drove him to take the Oath of the Slayers to forevermore seek death in battle at the hands of the most deadly enemy they can find. He was torn between conflicting vows: the Slayer Oath to seek out death and the oath of a King to protect his people. His son inherited his vows and continued the line of Slayer Kings, of which King Ungrim Ironfist is but the latest.

Although Ungrim cannot seek his death in the Slayer fashion, he grows ever more restless, leading the throng of Karak Kadrin into countless battles. Inspired by his High King and seeking to avenge the death of his lone son who was slain, Ungrim will march to war with the least provocation.	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc03_political_party_beastmen_malagor	The Beastmen believe that Malagor is the doom of mankind personified. He is a figure of nightmare, revered by the Beastmen but feared, above all, by superstitious men. To the denizens of the Empire, Malagor is the harbinger of disaster and destruction; the very embodiment of their downfall. Vilified by the Cult of Sigmar as the epitome of sin, he is depicted in holy wood carvings and tapestries as the ultimate evil - a figure that all Sigmar-fearing men should fight against or despair.

From the moment of his birth, it was obvious that Malagor was blessed by the Dark Gods, being possessed of a pair of feathered pinions as black as the night. Though Malagor is a Bray-Shaman he does not give his counsel to any one chieftain. Instead, his whisperings steer the course of the entire Beastmen race, visiting the herdstones and shrines across the Great Forest or even venturing deep beyond his normal bounds to cavort in long-devastated civilisations.

When the Beastmen rise and invade the lands of men with Malagor at its head, buildings will be destroyed and temples torn down or put to flame. Malagor desires nothing less than to cast down gods and goddesses of all kinds, to defile their altars, slay their priests - for he represents the Beastmen's ultimate goal: utter ruin for the Uncloven Ones.	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_main_political_party_lzd_kroq_gar	"Summon Grymloq. Now we hunt!"

To the south of the world, in much warmer, jungle climes, live the Lizardmen. These reptilian champions of Order are not one race but a collective of various cold-blooded creatures all dedicated to bringing the Great Plan of the Old Ones – the stellar race that terraformed the world before the Ancient Enemy brought ruin – to fruition.

The Lizardmen are led by the Slann Mage-Priests, who in turn are served by the adaptable Skinks, the labouring Kroxigor and the fearsome warrior-caste, the mighty Saurus. It is the Saurus that form the bulk of the Lizardmen armies for they are spawned for that sole purpose – bringing war to those deigned as enemies by the Mage-Priests.

Just because the Saurus have no concerns beyond battle does not mean they are limited in intellect. Far from it, in fact, for they excel in the role for which they are specifically spawned. None among their number is more capable or feared by the warmbloods than Kroq-Gar, Last Defender of Xhotl. Kroq-Gar is an Ancient Scar-Leader and a legendary presence amongst the Lizardmen, for he has fought Daemons and countless enemies over untold millennia.

Unquestioningly, Kroq-Gar was blessed by the Old Ones during his spawning, for he was among the last survivors of Xhotl, a temple-city that suffered constant Daemonic attack during the Great Cataclysm. After the loss of his home temple-city, he continued to fight; master-less, he and his Saurus Warriors ranged far across the jungles seeking out foes and interlopers, of which there are many.

In recent centuries, Kroq-Gar has fallen under the sway of Lord Mazdamundi. The great second generation Mage-Priest recognised in him an eternal warrior spirit and gifted him the Hand of Gods, a relic of the Old Ones. Strategically positioned for the coming wars, Mazdamundi has sent Kroq-Gar and his loyal cohorts across the World Pond to the Southlands. The Last Defender has been tasked with re-establishing the failing Geomantic Web and bringing about the next stage of the Great Plan: the annihilation of the myriad enemies of Order.	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_political_party_vor_def_hellebron	The Dark Elves were once Asur, the same race as the High Elves. What separates them is that the Druchii unleashed their minds from the iron discipline that all Elves require else they slip into depravity. The Druchii opened their hearts to the gods of the Cytharai, the Elven gods of the Underworld.

Of all the underworld gods it was Khaine, God of Murder, who rose to prominence, and especially in Har Ganeth - the City of Executioners. It is a cursed place. A madness overtook that city long ago, a thirst for blood and flesh that has just been kept in abeyance by some of the strictest laws in all Naggaroth. Only in Har Ganeth are acts such as murder, thievery, and public debauchery treated as crimes. The penalty for any infraction is, of course, death by execution. This is a heavy burden to bear for a folk with such a proclivity for violence and homicide; but that is the point, for the slightest leeway would lead to utter depravity and the madness taking hold again.

The release for all this pent-up, violent aggression comes on Death Night, an eve of bloody excess in Khaine's glorious name. As soon as the sun sets, so do the city's draconian laws, and all hell breaks loose as Witch Elves, nobles and even slaves take to the streets to revel in murder. Scores are settled and new ones created in a night of diabolical violence. And only as the dawn gong rings out across the city, and the sated survivors attempt to flee the street, does Har Ganeth’s ruler make an appearance. The gates to the palace swing open and Hellebron, accompanied by her elite guard, emerges to sweep the streets of those engorged and slow with the night’s excesses.

Hellebron is the Blood Queen, High Priestess of Khaine and most powerful of all Witch Elves. Her only true rival in power is Morathi, whom she despises. For the Witch King’s mother has withheld the secret of eternal youth from Hellebron. And so, while Morathi keeps her eldritch beauty, time leeches upon Hellebron. She becomes a withered crone, and only by bathing in Cauldrons of Blood can she temporarily restore her youthful aspect. But every year, the enchantment wears off quicker and more blood is required. It is this constant attainment to a lost and fleeting beauty that drives the Blood Queen ever onward...	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc06_political_party_belegar_ruler	Karak Eight Peaks was once a Greathold, second only to the majesty and strength of Everpeak in the Karaz Ankor. It was ruled by Clan Angrund, whose Royal line can trace its Ancestry back to Grungni and Valaya, which makes the loss of Eight Peaks the most bitter of grudges for all Dwarfs. None feel it more so than the descendants of King Lunn, the last Dwarf to sit on its throne. 

Since the fall of Karak Eight Peaks, Clan Angrund has scattered across the Karaz Ankor but retained significant sway simply because of its legacy. When Belegar Ironhammer, descended from King Lunn, rose to power he made great oaths - that he would not rest until the lost Hold had been reclaimed and he, its rightful heir, sat upon its throne. The High King, Thorgrim Grudgebearer, was initially sceptical – Ironhammer’s expedition would not be the first to attempt such a feat. Karak Eight Peaks has notoriously been riddled with foes of all kinds ever since its fall. Currently, a particularly sneaky and cunning Night Goblin 'Warlord' rules the upper levels of Eight Peaks, one who has easily thwarted such quests in the past.

Yet two things work to Belegar's advantage. Skarsnik has problems of his own right now - problems of the mutinous kind - and Belegar has a will of iron, as a great leader who excels at subterranean warfare. It should be noted, though, that this is his fourth attempt to recapture his Ancestral fortress, to the great shame of all Dawi, living or dead. However, the Ironhammer will not easily be stopped. Finally, after decades spent fostering the support of Guilds and allies, and with the full support of the High King, Belegar gathers Clan Angrund at Karak Izor. Once more a throng of vengeful Dwarfs will set off under Ironhammer’s command, to claim what is rightfully theirs!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_main_political_party_dwarf_ruler	Thorgrim Grudgebearer is the current High King of the Dwarfs. He is a throwback to the High Kings of old - eager for new conquests, mighty in battle, and a merciless enemy. Yet upon his worn brow, there also sits great wisdom, and he is able to uphold the ancient traditions as well as to accept (if not embrace) needed changes, such as alliances and new technology. Thorgrim is forever brooding upon how to return his people to their former glory. As the ultimate ruler of the Dwarfs, the Great Book of Grudges is entrusted into his keeping. It is Thorgrim’s avowed wish to avenge every single entry contained in that voluminous tome. Such is his resolve that he has already rejuvenated the Karaz Ankor. Tales of his deeds, and the long list of grudges already struck out, fill his grim warriors with the feeling that the Dwarfs have long done without: hope. A new age of retribution has begun.	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_main_political_party_hef_tyrion	"Our beautiful land is besieged on all sides, but we resist like our fathers before us. We will emerge victorious and more intractable than ever to these turbulent times when our corrupt brothers come to ravage our shores. We are the Asur, the sons of Aenarion and Ulthuan shall never fall."

The ancient High Elves have long stood guard over the world, ensuring it remains in balance – Daemonic efforts of hordes of Chaos and the foolish meddling of younger, ‘lesser’ races notwithstanding. Known among their kind as the Asur, the High Elves are both conceited and detached, no doubt due to their immense longevity and the comparative isolation of their island kingdom of Ulthuan, which forces such a worldview to a great extent. Whereas in other races such traits could prove fatal, in the Asur’s case they are assets, for the Elves have used them to attain knowledge and skills in magic and war that far outstrip those of almost all their historical adversaries.

Now, there is one among the Asur – a warrior so great that he has yet to meet his match with a blade: Prince Tyrion, Heir of Aenarion and Defender of Ulthuan. So impressive are Tyrion’s martial talents, so perfectly does he combine skill-at-arms with speed of thought, that there are many among the Asur who consider him to be both the world’s greatest living warrior and the reincarnation of the first Phoenix King, Aenarion, said to be reborn and living again through the young prince.

Unswervingly loyal to the current Phoenix King, Finubar, and the Everqueen, Alarielle, Tyrion discharges his duty as Ulthuan’s defender with the utmost seriousness, spending much of his time building up and training the High Elves’ armies into a fighting force with few equals, if any. 

There are also many entries in the Asur’s Book of Days that stand testament to the prince’s personal bravery – during the cataclysmic Battle of Finuval Plain, against his arch enemy, the Witch King Malekith, and his Dark Elf forces, Prince Tyrion even rescued the Everqueen from the battlefield, and has remained her consort and closest advisor ever since.	true

The High Elves – or Asur as they call themselves – are among the oldest civilisations in the world; possibly, only the jungle-dwelling Lizardmen can lay claim to a longer existence. Although mortal, Elves lead incredibly long lives; so long, in fact, that the spans allotted to men seem to be as fleeting as those of mayflies. From their island fortress-paradise of Ulthuan near the centre of the world, the High Elves – although aloof and arrogant in their manner – have generally walked the path of Order, using their longevity to become warriors without peer and mages without equal.

As descendants of Aenarion, the first Phoenix King, the twin brothers Tyrion and Teclis were marked for greatness from the moment they were born, like all of his line. Whereas Tyrion is renowned for his martial excellence, Teclis, who could not hope to match his brother’s physical prowess, instead became a magic-user of no small note. Widely considered to be the most powerful sorcerer of the age and one of the greatest ever to walk the world, there are few, if any, capable of defeating him in a duel, not even the vengeance-obsessed Dark Elf Witch King, Malekith.

Unlike his brother, who considers the defence of the High Elf kingdom of Ulthuan his chief duty, Teclis has a care for the whole world and sees it as his duty to prevent it falling into the hands of the Ruinous Powers. It is this generosity of spirit that has seen the High Elves allied with such disparate races as the men of the Empire and the Lizardmen of Lustria, impacting the former to the extent that the Empire’s fabled Colleges of Magic would never have existed if it was not for Teclis’ wise counsel and tuition in magical matters. Such is his renown, Teclis – the Loremaster of Hoeth and Warden of the White Tower – casts a shadow so lengthy that his influence will be felt right across the world long after his death.	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_vor_tmb_khatep	Even when they lived, the Tomb Kings of Nehekhara – or Priest Kings as they were – were obsessed with death. It infuriated them that the gods had seen fit to only grant them just a few short decades upon the world to make their mark and none rankled under that knowledge more than the Great King Settra.

Despite having conquered all Nehekhara and ensuring that much of Khemri was made in his image, Settra was obsessed with not just creating a legacy, but outliving it. And so he ordered the Mortuary Cult formed – its purpose to discover the ultimate secret: to cheat death. The Priesthood of the Mortuary Cult was led by Khatep, an extremely gifted and wise seer. It was Khatep who tended to Settra’s dying mortal form and promised the Great King that he would rise again on the Day of Awakening. As the years past, the hieratic cult’s quest for lore was partially successful. The priests themselves learnt how to sustain a form of Unlife, their spirits tethered to their desiccated bodies, yet the knowledge to bring back the kings as eternal demi-gods still lay beyond their grasp. However, they were undeterred and their search continued, all while serving their living kings as advisors and viziers. Thus, the Mortuary Cult spread across Nehekhara.

The arrival of the Arch-Necromancer changed everything. Following the casting of Nagash’s Great Ritual, civil war threatened Nehekhara and Khatep took it upon himself to restore order. He broke open the seals to Settra’s Grand Pyramid, which caused the Great King to rise, filled with an unquenchable wrath. However, Settra had not risen as a beatific sovereign but as a ravaged mummy – this was not the Day of Awakening promised by the Mortuary Cult! Settra raged and banished Khatep from Khemri.

To this day Khatep the Liche Lord remains the nominal head of the Mortuary Cult; since his exile he wanders the world, at first restricted to roaming Nehekhara's vast deserts, but of late he has travelled further afield, gathering followers and fellow exiles to seek out the lost lore he hopes will return the Lands of Nehek to glory and rehabilitate his reputation as their saviour!	true

Queek will show the whole world that Queek is the mightiest, the best, the most deadly! We will see what Gnawdwell says about orders then."

The Skaven are vile, malevolent ratmen that swarm beneath the surface of the world. Hidden in their sprawling underground lairs, they gnaw at the roots of civilisation, plotting and scheming for the day they will burst from their dark tunnels and drown the world above in a tide of mangy fur, rusty blades and plague-ridden filth.

The Skaven Under-Empire consists of countless clans. Each one – just like each individual Skaven – jostles for position, status and power. The four Greater Clans are unassailable in this never-ending race, but under them, the Warlord Clans are a thriving mass of betrayal and broken alliances. Clan Mors is currently the most powerful, their ascendancy in no small part due to their control of the City of Pillars – the lower levels of Karak Eight Peaks and an important nexus of the Under-Empire. While the grand ruler of Clan Mors, Warlord Gnawdwell, takes his seat on the Council of Thirteen in the ratmen capital of Skavenblight, the City of Pillars falls under Gnawdwell’s infamous ‘Right Claw’: Queek Headtaker.

The scarlet-armoured, fur-clad warrior of rage and ego is Queek Headtaker - scion of Clan Mors and one of the most accomplished and fierce fighters in all Skavendom. He is despised by Dwarfs for the sheer amounts of heads he has taken, with a record number of entries in the Great Book of Grudges, but he is also hated by Greenskins and Elves too. The only thing more renowned than Queek’s fighting prowess is his arrogance. The Headtaker is a power-hungry narcissist who carries the severed heads of his latest victims upon his trophy rack, advertising to enemies and followers just how truly great he is.

While Queek has carved quite the powerbase under Eight Peaks, Gnawdwell sends him wherever Clan Mors needs him to be. The Council of Thirteen - of which Gnawdwell is a part - see Headtaker as a powerful asset to enable their plans, whether Queek agrees with them or not!	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_main_political_party_def_malekith	"If they shall not bow to me, the rightful ruler of Ulthuan, then I shall see each tower crumble and every soul scourged in pain until they beg for my rule."

Long ago, the near-immortal Elves were a single race, united in outlook. Then came a great divide, when avarice, jealousy and malevolence boiled over and forever tore apart their civilisation. Denied the throne and then rejected by the god Asuryan’s purifying flames, Malekith, rightful son of Aenarion, has declared himself forever the enemy of Ulthuan and the Asur.

Although Malekith’s broken body was healed by his mother, the Hag Sorceress Morathi, using magical means, he remains scarred from the encounter and twisted by an inalienable desire to avenge himself upon those once considered kin. There are none among the Druchii – Malekith’s Elven supporters – who have seen his face, for his entire body lies encased within a suit of enchanted, black-metal armour said to be fused to his flesh. Many among the Druchii even mutter that Morathi’s Dark Magic has rendered her son immortal. Whether or not this is true, Malekith promises dire vengeance upon the Asur, vowing to wipe Ulthuan forever from the face of the world if he is denied the Phoenix Throne again.

Deep within the Dark Elves’ bleak kingdom of Naggaroth, plans are afoot to bring about the High Elves’ downfall. To this end, Malekith has spent centuries training to become the perfect warrior, a much-dreaded sorcerer, and an ‘inspirational’ leader, although fear of the ‘Witch King’, as he is now known is, in many cases, the galvanising element.

 Malekith’s forces have followed him across the world in pursuit of his dark goal, and have faced the High Elves on many occasions; in spite of this, Ulthuan still stands. Nothing if not persistent, Malekith knows that soon there will be a final reckoning between the Elves – the Druchii will rise, the Asur will fall, and the work of millennia will at last be complete. If the Witch King cannot rule Ulthuan, then no one will!	true

The Savage Orc Shaman has crossed the Southlands and headed deep into the Badlands, joining tribes and rekindling the spark of the Waaagh! in them that they may have lost. His words and presence can lift a tribe to greater things in the name of Gork (or perhaps Mork). In the Land of the Dead, Wurrzag joined the Spotted Skullz tribe, leading them to victory against the Undead legions and their animated statuary. There are many other examples of Wurrzag's interventions, and so his reputation has spread far and wide.

Among most tribes, his arrival is seen as a blessing that Mork (or Gork, maybe) has chosen them for some special mission. Not all Warbosses are so welcoming, however. Some view Wurrzag with suspicion, reckoning he comes always on the eve of events set in motion already, taking the credit even though it was the Bosses that did all the zoggin’ work in the first place! They argue that a Waaagh! can happen and countless do without Wurrzag present to trigger them. Whatever the truth, Wurrzag certainly believes he was put on this mortal plane as a tool of the Green Godz, and when Orcs believe something, then fate has a habit of making it true...	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_vor_tmb_khalida	Beyond the Badlands lies the Land of the Dead. This desert realm is the cradle of mankind’s earliest empire – a civilisation known as Nehekhara that did not just huddle the banks of the Great Vitae River, but straddled the mountains to reach the shores of the Bitter Sea.

To the east, it was dominated by the cities of Lahmia, Mahrak and Lybaras – ruled by great matriarchs. Even so, Khemri remained its greatest prize. When Nagash, the Arch-Necromancer, was defeated by the Army of the Seven Kings, High Queen Neferata of Lahmia acted quickly, even as the alliance dissipated. In secret, she stole the forbidden lore of Nagash to recreate the Elixir of Life. But Neferata’s own concoction was flawed – it did indeed extend her life, but the cost was an unyielding thirst for blood. Neferata had unwittingly created a race that would blight all the world forever more, she became the first Vampire.

By the time her cousin, Khalida of Lybaras, visited for a great feast, most of the Lahmian Court were infected with Vampirism. To display her new found power, Neferata challenged her cousin to ritual combat in front of all in attendance. The two women fought before the shocked nobility, their blades weaving a deadly and delicate dance. But Neferata was no longer a mere mortal, and so bested her cousin. As Khalida lay dying, Neferata let her own cursed blood infect the Lybaran queen, as a final, spiteful act. The Warrior-Queen cried to the gods in desperation, and one answered! The Asp-Goddess heard Khalida's pleas and purged the taint from her veins, at the cost of her life. Khalida’s body was borne back to Lybaras in sorrow, where she was embalmed and placed upon her throne, ready to defend her city and godly patron from behind the wall of death.

When the Tomb Kings finally awoke from their breathless sleep, Khalida remained on her throne, uninterested in the power-grabbing and politicking of these Undying tyrants. However, when Lybaras is threatened, Khalida acts, and quickly. At Asaph's bidding, she silently rises from her throne and commands her loyal legions to march forth. Khalida fights not merely out of loyalty to the goddess who aided her, she harbours a deep, eternal loathing – not just for her cousin, but all Vampires who dare cross her path.	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_vor_cst_the_drowned_ruler	Cylostra Direfin is the vengeful spirit who commands the Lamprey, a cursed ship of rotten wood and tattered sails that oft appears out of the raging tempests of the open sea. Many decades ago, Cylostra was the favourite court singer of Bretonnian royalty, a prima donna of considerable size and with the proverbial ‘artistic temperament’ in spades, who never accepted anything less than having things all her own way. Her great volatility and intimidating demeanour meant that no-one ever dared refuse her demands.

Unfortunately for both Cylostra and ultimately the world, she was a passenger aboard the Lamprey during an important diplomatic voyage to perform for the Phoenix King. Amid a gale of truly epic proportions, the Bretonnian galleon went down in a violent electrical storm, drowning everyone on board, but as the legend goes, Cylostra had already usurped the ship’s meek captain before it sank, simply for daring to delay her performance by attempting to circumvent the dangerous weather! In a fit of rage, and demonstrating a near-unnatural physical strength born of her passion for music, she threw him overboard in what was, up to that point in her life, an uncharacteristic act of cold-blooded murder. Ordering the subjugated crew to keep the ship on course directly into the storm, Cylostra’s delusions of grandeur even made her believe that she could demand safe passage from the tempest itself by singing determinedly over the howling gales. Sadly, for her, the elements cannot so easily be tamed. As the Lamprey sank down beneath the waves, her futile, pitch-perfect notes turned to shrill, gurgled screaming.

Under normal circumstances, that would’ve been the end for most beings, but Cylostra’s bloated ego refused Morr’s embrace and she rose again in the ultimate act of diva-like defiance. Now, her tortured soul roams the seas, eternally searching for an appreciative audience. Those who know the legend of the ‘Siren of the Storm’ flee in terror at the sight of her ghostly, barnacle-strewn galleon, for it is said that when it appears with Cylostra singing upon its bow like a dreadful, Unliving figurehead, her songs of death paralyse all those unfortunate enough to hear them before her Undead crew – whom she refers to rather theatrically as ‘The Drowned’ – appear to drag them down into a watery grave, before they are raised again to join the Madame-Captain’s ratings for a life of unfettered piracy and murder!	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_main_political_party_chaos_ruler	Archaon is the Everchosen, the Lord of the End Times, the vessel through which the Dark Gods will unite their followers and turn the whole world into a Realm of Chaos.

The man who was to become Archaon was once a devout Templar Priest of Sigmar, pure in heart and deed. The Priest uncovered a set of heretical manuscripts transcribed by one of the acolytes of the infamous Necrodomo the Insane, a prophet who tore out his own eyes after having a vision of the destruction of the world at the hands of Chaos.

What Archaon learned from these texts is unknown, but legend has it that he uncovered a terrible truth which drove him into a screaming rage. Rejecting the gods of the Empire, he burned down the temple around him and raged amongst the flames. He renounced his own name and swore he would not only give himself body and soul to Chaos, but also forge a new life as the scourge of the deluded fools who worship the Empire’s false gods.	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_main_political_party_vampire_ruler	Before rising to his current power, Mannfred von Carstein avoided the infighting of his peers and instead travelled far and wide, seeking to deepen his knowledge of necromantic lore. He made unholy pilgrimages to ancient tombs and cities, where he wrested forbidden secrets from bone-dry scrolls made from human skin, studied ancient spells in the first of the Books of the Dead and struck foul bargains with powerful long-dead beings.

When Mannfred finally returned to Sylvania, he was more powerful than ever, and he took over the Undead legions in the wake of his insane predecessor’s destruction. Though previously he had travelled in the guise of an Imperial lord, now at the height of his power his appearance has become more horrifying – his face became contorted and corpse-like, and his scalp writhing with magical energy. Yet his new-found powers are not enough, and he thirsts for evermore as part of his designs for the Imperial throne.	true

As he walks, worms and insects fester to the surface, rivers travel the wrong way, and fire flits through the air. The Bray-Shamans claim that if the physical body of Morghur is cut down, then his vile spirit is simply reborn elsewhere. To the Gors, he is the essence of Chaos - the collective will of all Beastmen to fight order and burn civilisation to the ground. While the Beastmen venerate this twisted creature, the Uncloven revile him. The only one to perhaps understand the true horror of Morghur is Queen Ariel of the Wood Elves. It is she alone who perceives what the Shadowgave actually represents: a spirit of evil too powerful to be contained within a single corporeal form. Thus war rages between the Asrai and the Beastmen as the Queen seeks a way to destroy Morghur forever. The Master of Skulls knows of this endeavour but is not concerned, yet hates the Wood Elves for all they represent in turn. And as they seek his destruction, Morghur dedicates all his demented thoughts to devising their ruin.	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_cst_sartosa_ruler	The most feared of all pirates who menace the waters surrounding the city-port of Sartosa and beyond is the ‘Queen of Tides’, Aranessa Anja Saltspite. Rumour has it that she was not sired by mortal man, but is actually the daughter of the Sea-God Manann, the ‘Seafather’ himself; that she rose fully grown out of the waves in a froth of gore, with seawater flowing through her veins instead of blood. Having been cast out by her Norscan tribe as a baby, she is said to have cut off her own fishtail before heading out to sea to seek her fortune, biding her time until she was strong enough – in every sense – to take her bloody revenge upon the people who left her for dead.

Whatever Aranessa’s origins, there can be no doubt that she is greatly favoured by the Sea-God, and that a peculiar connection exists between them, for she has sailed the Great Ocean to the very ends of the world and back, through the most violent of tempests, yet always emerges unscathed. Aranessa knows that it is her duty to protect the Seafather’s realm as he protects her, but the sea is vast, and such a task would take countless lifetimes, so Manann has granted her some of the world’s most powerful seafarers – Vampire Admirals, with whom he has made pacts in exchange for their aid. Aranessa is not entirely comfortable with this alliance, but knows her Necromantic officers are undeniably useful. As Manann washes the corpses of dead sailors against the Swordfysh’s hull and upon the shores of Sartosa, her allies breathe Unlife into them, thus fortifying her crew with shipmates Manann considers more ‘permanent’.

Associations with the Undead aside, those who have met Aranessa and lived say she is a strange character indeed. Peg-legged from her long career as a buccaneer, she has no warmth in her soul and absolutely no love for man. Only the open seas and the glitter of gems can melt her scowl, but as Aranessa’s crew maintain, on those rare occasions where she deigns to smile it is like a new dawn. But what manner of dawn? A dawn of merciless, cutthroat violence, theft and murder, which rages without end – that sort of dawn. Beholden to no man, be he living or dead, Captain Aranessa Saltspite – the self-styled ‘Pirate Queen’ – is every bit as merciless as the Great Ocean itself!	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_political_party_vor_hef_alarielle	Avelorn lies at the heart of Ulthuan and the Everqueen is its sovereign. Her realm is the principal site of the Earth Mother, and she is regarded as the spiritual leader of the entire Elven realm. The position of the Everqueen is always taken by the previous queen's firstborn daughter, conceived during her year-long ritual marriage to the Phoenix King. After this formal marriage, they are free to take fresh consorts, but only the daughter of the Phoenix King can be the new Everqueen. Hence the queens of Avelorn have always been the Everqueens of Ulthuan, forming an unbroken chain from ages past.

Avelorn itself is ancient. Its great forest is the oldest of all Elf realms. Ancient glamours lie upon its tangled groves, and creatures of legend - Treemen, Nymphs and Dryads - still walk beneath its eaves. It is a place of outstanding beauty and visceral danger to intruders, even the monsters that wander down from the Annulii mountains.

The court of the Everqueen is always on the move, travelling through Avelorn from place-to-place like a great carnival, pitching silken pavilions wherever it halts. By day, silver laughter rings through the forest as the Elves make sport. By night, faerie lights flicker in the darkness, illuminating the revels and feasting.

And yet, to mistake this Everqueen as merely a totem of the Earth Mother, Isha, would be unwise. She has a shrewd grasp of the political games played by Elven royals, and sends her own envoys to the courts - the Handmaidens - to ensure the good of all Ulthuan is upheld when such machinations are underway. And while Everqueens of the past may have avoided the battlefield, Alarielle the Radiant joins the fight without hesitation. Her power drawn from the hearts of all Asur, she is anathema to creatures of fell spirit, and no one can speak falsehood in her presence. So it is that a High Elf army might find glorious aid in its darkest hour, when the Radiant goes to war...	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_pro02_political_party_vampire_isabella	Hurriedly married to the dark stranger Vlad by her father, ‘Mad Otto’, in order to avoid the ascent of her depraved Uncle Leopold, Isabella soon became a von Carstein far more than in name alone. Already narcissistic, prideful, and immoral in the extreme, the heir to Sylvania’s throne was, in so many ways, an ideal candidate for the Blood Kiss. To any other suitor, they would have been abhorrent, deal-breaking qualities, but not so Vlad von Carstein.

For Isabella, the marriage was at first purely one of convenience, but as the months passed her natural resistance to his charms caused Vlad to fall deeply in love with his pale bride and she for him. Although he tried to resist her requests to taste the Blood Kiss, to be made Unliving, the terrible, wasting disease that threatened to kill his coldly-beautiful new wife forced his hand. Realising that he could not continue without her, Vlad gave the dying Isabella what she desired and inducted her into the Midnight Aristocracy’s nefarious ranks.

Ever since then, the pair have been together – Isabella standing proudly by Vlad’s side, nourishing his lust for power and dominion over the Empire and beyond. On the field of battle, when fighting alongside her husband, she is strengthened by his presence and he by hers. Oft-times, Isabella von Carstein carries the Blood Chalice of Bathori before her, a goblet of gold that belonged to her bloodthirsty ancestor, brimming with fresh blood at all times. She sups it constantly, even in the cut and thrust of the fray – the blood healing her wounds almost instantly and confounding her opponents just long enough for the killing blow to be struck!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_vor_skv_tretch_craventail	The Skaven are the ratmen gnawing at the roots of the world – an evil and conniving race that outnumber all their enemies. If only they could stop squabbling and backstabbing for long enough, and join together in one mighty alliance, then all their enemies would be wiped out under a furry tide of screeching vermin.

But that is not how the Skaven think. Betrayal, duplicity, and cowardice are the true marks of the Skaven, and in many parts of the Under-Empire such traits are lauded as virtues. Clan Rictus vaunts these qualities – they are extremely rich, with treasure holds said to rival even those of Clan Mors. Rictus dominates the passages and tunnels under Crookback Mountain, a nest-lair deep in the Dark Lands to the east of the World's Edge. However, of late their focus has been pulled far to the west…

Tretch Craventail has no right to the title of Grand Chieftain of the Deep Warrens, and yet, none answer to it but he. The wretch has risen quickly through the ranks of Clan Rictus on a mixture of luck and outright, unashamed treachery. However, no Skaven can survive on luck alone, and so Tretch is also one of the most conniving and cruel ratmen to have lived in recent times. He has developed – or it was within him all along? – an absolute knack for knowing when lethal trouble is close. It’s at these times that Craventail will mysteriously disappear, leaving whichever retinue he was 'leading' to their inevitable fate.

But despite such a 'boon' – whether a natural talent or a gift from the Horned One himself – Tretch has finally come to the attention of Clan Rictus’ leader, Lord Kratch Doomclaw, a sitting member of the Council of Thirteen. Doomclaw has ordered Tretch lead a Clan Rictus expedition to the Elf-thing lands of Naggaroth, far to the west of Crookback Mountain. It is unclear exactly what Lord Kratch’s motives are but they're probably not altruistic in nature – maybe a play for power using his most capable Chieftains, or a way to rid himself of an annoying and potential rival? Most probably, it is both...	true

Reject false-words of seers and embrace true face of the Horned One! Bring Skrolk to the Wormstone, and you will be Plague Priest. Betray, and you become pus-bag."

Underneath the world lurks the Skaven - a race of noisome ratmen that despise all other things and desire world domination with every fibre of their twisted beings - from their quivering whiskers to the tips of their segmented tails.

Clan Pestilens is one of the four Greater Clans. Its members are the Plague Monks – the disciples of disease and decay. Clan Pestilens dedicate themselves with insane fervour to spreading corruption in the name of the Great Horned Rat. Pestilens was the first clan to reach Lustria; there, in the hot, fetid conditions, did the disease-ridden ratmen start to overcome the climate to found Clan Pestilens. It wasn’t long before the emergent clan encountered the Lizardmen and an age-old enmity was born. Of all the warm-blooded invaders to trespass on Lustria, it is the Skaven – and Clan Pestilens in particular – that the Lizardmen hate the most. Eventually, after decades of self-imposed exile, the Plague Monks re-joined the Under-Empire and immediately claimed their place on the Council of Thirteen. Their leader is Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch, and while he controls the clan from Skavenblight it is Lord Skrolk that remains in Lustria to return Pestilens to greatness.

Lord Skrolk is an affront to nature. Plants wither and die where Skrolk treads and even the air around him seems to congeal and darken. Skrolk is ancient and blind, but only a fool would mistake his lack of sight for weakness… In battle, Skrolk leads from the front so he can unleash his rabid fury, wielding the Rod of Corruption and reading from the Liber Bubonicus - a tome describing every disease conjured by Pestilens that even the Chaos God, Nurgle, is said to covet. But Skrolk’s greatest asset is and always will be his cunning. This Plague Priest has lived for countless centuries and is far more than a mere frenzied zealot!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc07_political_party_bretonnia_fay	The Lady of the Lake is the principle Bretonnian deity, said to embody the pure, noble, courageous spirit for which the kingdom is known. Her earthly representative is the Fay Enchantress, who watches over Bretonnia from her tower in Carcassonne and upon whose wise counsel King Louen depends. In fact, during times of dynastic crisis, the Enchantress is empowered to choose the next Royarch from amongst the dukes and has, on at least one prior occasion, stripped a tyrannical or cruel ruler of his throne and commanded his own Knights to forcibly expel the oppressor from the Kingdom! Whilst undoubtedly ancient – some say thousands of years old even – the Enchantress appears to all as a beautiful young woman and is reincarnated instantly as soon as her host body wears out. Although undoubtedly a fearsome sorceress more than capable of defeating her enemies by herself, the Fay Enchantress is served by her loyal body of Grail Knights, whose lives are sworn to protect her person and obey any and all commands. She is also served by the Damsels and Prophetesses of the Lady, who are called into her service as children and become her acolytes, eventually having not insignificant magical powers of their own.

The Enchantress is the one who rouses the usually competitive Dukedoms of Bretonnia into united action when the kingdom is threatened by evil forces from without. It has even been known, at times of mortal peril, for her to ride into battle ahead of an army of her fiercely-loyal Grail Knights. On the battlefield, she uses magic to both protect Bretonnian forces from attack or weaken and strike down the foe – sometimes with a single, furious stare!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_vor_cst_noctilus_ruler	The immortal Vampire Counts of Sylvania – known to most as the Midnight Aristocracy – seldom venture from the comfort of their dank castles and certainly very few have been known to leave their fell feeding grounds for the uncertain life of the sea-borne adventurer. Nyklaus von Carstein, therefore, is something of an anomaly among his kind…

 The infamous fleet commander now known as Count Noctilus is leader of the Dreadfleet – a malevolent gathering of dissolute (and desiccated) Undead warship captains, including notorious privateers such as the Shadewraith, the Skabrus, the Black Kraken and the Curse of Zandri, among others, who bring abject ruin to the high seas and damnation to living seafarers. Although once a member of Sylvania’s aristocratic Vampire dynasty, he had a markedly different vision from his squabbling peers of how he would achieve Necromantic supremacy. After studying the countless charts which map the ebb and flow of magic across the world, von Carstein realised that by mastering the art of seafaring he would be able to harness the magical gales that whirl and cascade across the oceans.

 This newfound route to power eventually led him to translocate himself and his Undead minions to the bone-choked morass of the Galleon’s Graveyard, a fell sea-based realm of the Unliving between the tangible and intangible worlds that entraps shipwrecked vessels from across the Great Ocean. It was in this mysterious place that Nyklaus von Carstein founded his darkling empire and renamed himself Count Noctilus.

At the centre of the Galleon’s Graveyard, Noctilus has feasted upon the magic of a sentient whirlpool known as the Maelstrom – a skull-strewn tempest of magic that sucks in shipwrecks, plunder, and drowned sailors from beyond the veil like a giant lodestone. By using the whirlpool’s raw power to draw in the shattered remains of dead warships, he has forged a grotesque seafaring vessel of his own – the Bloody Reaver, an amalgam of rotting galleons and eldritch power upon which sits the dark and jagged crag of his floating castle, standing proudly like a conqueror’s statue! 

As the clock strikes midnight, the Dreadfleet heads out to sea, its Undead captains eager to slake their unholy thirsts. Their warships of the damned emerge from banks of sulphurous fog, illuminated only by flickering, pallid ghostlights, drawing closer with the sickening slowness of a recurring nightmare before the silence is broken by the thunderous roar of their lethal broadsides! After each raid, the Dreadfleet disappears back into its watery lair as quickly and silently as it first appeared, far from the reach of the living.	true

It is this approval that means the most to Louen, for in years past he completed a Grail Quest, expelling evil from Bretonnian lands before supping from the mystical chalice and receiving the Lady’s blessing. From his capital at Couronne, the King rules wisely and with an even-hand when dealing with Knight or noble alike. Fairness in all matters is his watchword, never allowing the law as written to compromise its noble intent, never refusing anyone – peasants excepted of course – a hearing in his presence to air grievances of which he must be the judge. So great is Louen’s statecraft and mastery of diplomacy that many consider him to be not just the natural successor of Gilles the Uniter, but believe he is descended from the same noble bloodline.

On the battlefield, Louen is a deadly adversary, a natural general, and the Lady’s chosen champion – leading the Knights of Bretonnia into the fray upon his noble Hippogryph, Beaquis, and smiting evil wherever he finds it. Somehow, the King has halted the aging process, appearing to be a much younger man than his birth records belie; maybe it is the Lady’s favour, her eternal blessings – or even her ethereal kiss – that enables Louen to hold back the advancing years and continue to lead his kingdom to glory? For glory is at hand – the time has come for Bretonnians to rally under King Louen’s banner and, with the blessing of the Lady and the protection of the Fay Enchantress, march on dark, corrupted Mousillon and bring it back under control once and for all!	true

The Lizardmen are the reptilian guardians of Order. They follow the Great Plan set down by the Old Ones, as interpreted by the Slann Mage-Priests who direct the small and capable Skinks, the Saurus Warriors, bestial Kroxigor and myriad other reptilian servants.

Being cold-blooded, Lizardmen reside in the warmer climates, mainly across the jungle-continent of Lustria and the Southlands. Hidden within the undergrowth are the temple-cities where the Slann contemplate and the other reptilian castes live to serve the Old Ones’ will. Shining brightest of all the ancient temple-cities is Hexoatl, the City of the Sun. Though Itza is the First City, Hexoatl has eclipsed it in importance due to its status as home to Lord Mazdamundi, the most active of all the remaining Slann Mage-Priests. Due to its location and history, the City of the Sun is the most fortified and martial of all the temple-cities. Whereas the boundaries of most other cities simply merge with the jungle, Hexoatl has mighty walls and serried ranks of Saurus patrol its plazas. Until recently, even the Norse trespassers of Skeggi and its surrounding colonies avoided Hexoatl, although that has changed of late.

Yet it is not just the city and its reptilian legions that enemies and invaders must be wary of, but its mighty leader, Lord Mazdamundi, oldest and most powerful of the living Slann Mage-priests; he who can bring ruination upon cities; he that rides the horned beast.

After years of contemplation, Mazdamundi has come to a simple epiphany: the Great Plan cannot move to the next phase until the first stage has been completed. This involves relocating a few, select races and the utter obliteration of the fell spawn that infests the world.

And so, with the fire of Old One, Chotec, burning within Lord Mazdamundi, the time of inaction is over – the Great Plan will be executed – order *will* come from Chaos, no matter the cost!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_vor_def_lokhir_fellheart_ruler	From the forbidding, blackened towers of their sprawling dread city-port Karond Kar, the Dark Elves – or Druchii, as they are called in the Elven tongue – wile away their extremely long lives indulging in internecine plots, twisted schemes, depraved, debauched acts of all kinds, and of course wanton cruelty, sickening torture and bad, old-fashioned death. With devotions such as these, you would think that a life of adventure on the perilous high seas of the Great Ocean – endlessly fighting, raiding and plundering, at great personal risk – would be far too much like hard work for the hedonistic Druchii. Yet there are some among their number who eschew the decadent lifestyles of their peers, throwing caution, and themselves, to the wind, quite literally.

Of course, for many the intention is to escape the dangers of Naggarothi life, where execution or murder, always accompanied by a smile, if not maniacal laughter, are always close by, if not waiting around the next corner. Not so in the case of Lokhir Fellheart – the dreaded ‘Krakenlord’. He was born to ply the rolling seas, bringing death to those stupid enough to attempt to traverse them, and fire, terror and enslavement to unsuspecting foreign shores. Countless ports and coastal cities lie ruined and ablaze in his wake, for Fellheart is the latest in a long line of doom-bringing admirals to command the Black Ark known as the Tower of the Blessed Dread.

As a result of his terrible exploits, Fellheart has accumulated much plunder – wealth beyond measure, in fact – along with far greater glory than all of his forebears combined. More treasure flows through Karond Kar than ever before – of both the shiny sort and the fleshy, enslaved kind – earning him the grudging respect, if not quite the trust, of the city-port’s Dreadlord masters. But that is enough for Fellheart, for he cares little for politics or anything much except loot and plunder and what it can buy him – the loyalty of his Corsairs and the lavish bribes he pays to insalubrious officials that enable him to operate freely. Although he keeps the best pieces for himself, Fellheart is admired by his crew for his generosity, a quality not normally associated with Dark Elves! They also trust him due to the personal courage he displays in battle, a dangerous habit that other Druchii admirals tend to lose as soon as they can, lest their days on account upon the Great Ocean be very few in number!

It is certainly true that the privations of sea-life, including his high-pressure command, have done little to blunt Lokhir Fellheart’s swordplay – he fights as naturally as he reads the oceans. Well aware that the loyalties of pirate crews hold only as long as their captain’s reputation, Fellheart relentlessly slays enemy heroes, tossing their severed heads onto an ever-growing pile, knowing full well that every skull adds another page to the book of his legend and gives mutineers more than a few compelling reasons not to cross swords with their captain!	true

Unfortunately for them, in their rabid scramble for loot they prised open Harkon’s burial chest, awakening him from his dreamless slumber. By the time the ship broke up on the rocky Lustrian coastline, all the ‘surviving’ crew had undergone something of a change, in both their allegiance and their vital signs…

Since that day, Harkon has ruled the region now known as the Vampire Coast, setting sail upon the Great Ocean in search of loot, plunder, and fresh recruits to raise into his service. As leader of a pirate fleet crewed exclusively by the dead and damned, he holds sway over a sea region of high winds and perilous currents that have proven to be incredibly treacherous to many unwary vessels, swelling his horde of Undead mariners with the reanimated corpses of shipwrecked unfortunates.

Luthor Harkon teeters constantly on the very brink of insanity due in no small part to his colossal pride and greed, qualities which on one devastating, fateful occasion led him to almost lose his life as well as his mind, and certainly lost him all of his magical abilities short of the power to raise his minions and bind them to his inexorable will. The story goes that, while on a fateful quest to further augment his already not-inconsiderable might, Harkon attempted to use his Dark Magic to enter a chamber inside a Lizardman temple buried deep within the deadly Lustrian jungle. Powerful glyphs barred his way, but he pushed onwards in spite of the barriers and driven by his fatal flaw – his great arrogance and hubris - causing the magical seals to retaliate and drain his magical power and then his lifeforce, whilst the walls of the ancient ritual chamber began to crumble. With supreme effort, Harkon managed to break free and stagger outside as the passageway collapsed behind him, but the damage had been done – his connection to the Winds of Magic was severed and his mind was shattered, leaving his personality fractured into a dozen different facets which to this day battle for dominance in his mind.

In the years since, the only common goal that Luthor Harkon’s various personalities have been able to work towards is that of finding a cure for his condition. To this end, the Pirate King of the Vampire Coast has bent his obsessions to seizing Slann artefacts in the hope that their power can heal his damaged psyche!	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_main_political_party_vor_def_morathi	"They will betray you, my son, they always do. Let me end them first."

All Elves were once as one, living in contentment in their island paradise of Ulthuan. Alas, nothing endures forever. The Daemons came and Aenarion strode forth to vanquish them. At first a mighty hero… then he drew the Sword of Khaine and doomed his line.

The Daemons were banished, the Great Vortex created, but in victory came the Elves’ ultimate defeat. A schism was rent between those who had been most loyal to Aenarion’s line, and the rest of Ulthuan. Soon Elf fought Elf and the Dark Elves, or, more accurately, the Druchii, were forged in war, blood and murder. The events that led to this sundering happened millennia ago, and yet, the grand architect of a whole race’s tragedy not only still lives but remains one of the most powerful of all their rulers. She is the mother of the Witch King; she is Morathi, the Hag Sorceress of Ghrond.

Morathi was Aenarion’s second wife. He rescued the beautiful seeress from a Slaaneshi host. As the legends tell it, they soon fell in love, and Morathi’s influence became absolute. Through their union came a son, Malekith, destined to become the Witch King. This alone guarantees Morathi a place in history, but she is far more than a mother alone. It was Morathi that broke apart the magical spectrum to fashion Dark Magic. It was she that spread the Cult of Pleasure throughout Ulthuan, fermenting the seeds of discord and ensuring that Malekith’s followers were ready when he made his move against the usurpers of Ulthuan.

To this day, Morathi is both revered and hated by her own kin. While the Witch King tolerates his mother, she is more likely to be manipulating events that furnish her own agenda. Seduction and assassination are her favoured weapons, although she is no stranger to open war. Over millennia the Cult of Pleasure’s influence has waxed and waned, but it has always remained under Morathi’s sway. And so - even as Malekith banishes the Hag Sorceress away from the traditional powerbase of Ghrond to the Ancient City of Quintex - her followers are ready and waiting.	true

Karl Franz is said to be the greatest statesman the Old World has ever seen. He is also a military genius and a valiant general. The Emperor frequently takes personal command of his soldiers, like Sigmar, the Warrior-God of old, smiting enemies of the Empire with every blow.

There is little doubt that Karl Franz is one of the greatest generals of his age. He stands at the forefront of the battles against those that would see his beloved realm torn asunder, and it is a responsibility that weighs heavily upon his shoulders.	true

A savage King, he is the vessel of the Elven God, Kurnous, the Hunter. However, Orion's savagery is tempered with the wisdom of Queen Ariel's guidance and that of the countless hosts who choose to take his form each year. Every vernal equinox, a young prince is taken to the Oak of Ages and there fashioned by the Elven Queen into the King's mighty form. With each year that passes, another chosen one is called and another voice added to the choir of personalities that influence Orion. The eldest are now the faintest of whispers, having lived as the King thousands of years hence, while the most recent add their youthful fury to the god-King's will. And yet the 'King in the Wood' persists, continuing to reign throughout the many seasons of his existence. In battle, when his realm  is threatened, Orion is the first to fight in its defence. Taking up his mighty weapons of war, he winds his great horn and calls the Elves of Athel Loren to the Wild Hunt!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc08_political_party_norsca_throgg	King Throgg is a most unusual Troll. His race is famed for their fierce ways and brutish strength and for a corresponding lack of intelligence but whilst Throgg may be a vicious brute, he is no idiot. In the bone-strewn wastes of Troll Country, at the heart of his icy labyrinth, he sits and thinks, brooding alone on his rocky throne, the filth-encrusted crown ringing one of his yellowed tusks a once-priceless heirloom taken from a great warrior whose noble quest led him only to Throgg's gullet.

Once, Throgg was happy with a life of hunting and killing. He led his monstrous kin in successful raids, ambushes and night attacks, using the harsh climate of the north as an ally; to a Troll like Throgg, a brutal ice-shard blizzard is no more troubling than a light summer rain. Throgg became known to the warriors of the Old World as Wintertooth, a fearsome and mindless adversary. 

Yet the mutations Throgg and his kin welcome can affect the mind too. One moonless night, as Throgg picked the flesh of his latest victim from his tusks, he stopped to consider the broken bodies of his prey. He began to think. As Throgg muttered to himself through the following days, his eyes burning with cold fire, a grim and malevolent cunning grew within him. If Man and the other races of the so-called civilised lands of the south were so keen to fight him and his bestial subjects, then fight them he would. He would gather a nightmarish horde of Chaos-infested creatures and overrun the lands of man in the name of the Dark Gods!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_pro02_political_party_vlad_ruler	The first and greatest of the Vampire Counts was Vlad von Carstein. Some say before his appearance in Sylvania over 700 years ago, he was in the Lahmian court at the time of Neferata’s ascendancy to immortality. Others believe him to be a dispossessed Empire noble who stumbled into Undeath but refused the damnation fate had placed upon him. Instead of withering, he set in motion events that would see the Vampire Counts - and the von Carstein name - challenge the greatest nation of men in the world.

Vlad was not the first Vampire encountered by the Empire, but before his rise to power these Undead creatures had been solitary predators. A few had perhaps amassed small forces and carved out far-flung domains, but it was Vlad’s usurpation of Sylvania and legitimate gaining of the title of Count that marked a new era of bloodshed. When he revealed his true intentions to the rest of the Empire, two hundred years after his arrival in that cursed region, he waged war in order to become Emperor - for he truly believed he had a legitimate claim to the throne. It has since become a burning desire of all his bloodline, who feel - righteously or not - that they should become Emperor, for is it not right that the farmer herds the cattle? Vlad has been thwarted in his quest on a few occasions, but has always managed to find a way back to Unlife. Now he has risen yet again – and his desire to conquer the mortal fools is as strong as ever!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc06_political_party_skarsnik_ruler	Throughout all of history, very few Goblins have risen to the top of the Greenskin food chain. Skarsnik is one of them. He is a Night Goblin whose supreme cunning and malign intellect far surpasses that of his peers. It is this gift, and the presence of his incredibly loyal and eternally-hungry Cave Squig, Gobbla, that has allowed him to climb the brutal hierarchy of the Crooked Moon tribe and remain at the top. Orcs typically struggle to take orders or be subservient to Goblins. Naturally, a few have tried to usurp Skarsnik, but needless to say that Gobbla ate especially well on such occasions - the sneaky Night Goblin’s cunning far outweighing an Orc’s brutal and direct challenge.

Whilst Skarsnik has retained an iron grip on his tribe, his real achievement (the one for which he is hated by both Dwarfs and Skaven alike) is his domination of Karak Eight Peaks, the former Dwarf mountain fortress. The self-proclaimed 'Warlord of the Eight Peaks' has controlled the surface for years, something which has enraged the stunties beyond forbearance!

Provoking the Dwarfs, or any of the Warlord’s many enemies, is what Skarsnik does best. A master of deception, he captures his foes and uses their tortured screams or body parts (scalped beards for stunties) to bait his ever-more devious traps. His targets almost always take the lure, as they are simply not used to Greenskins having such an intricate take on warfare. However, as Skarsnik’s evil reputation continues to grow, fewer adversaries dare underestimate him. Truly, the Warlord of the Eight Peaks is one to be feared!	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc07_political_party_bretonnia_alberic	Bordeleaux is one of the founding dukedoms of Bretonnia, occupying the western coastal region just south of cursed Mousillon. The current duke is the courageous yet stern Alberic, known for his strict adherence to the rules of chivalry and the preservation of the natural order. Knights trained under Alberic are among the very best Bretonnia has to offer, showing almost suicidal levels of bravery on the battlefield – never shrinking from an opponent, no matter their size or reputation. Duke Alberic’s coat of arms bears the distinctive Trident of Manann, the Sea God, who watches over Bordeleaux’s coastlines and vies with the Lady of the Lake for the affections of its people, such is his importance in the region. Certainly, along the sea routes and among sea-borne traders, Manann is considered the more popular patron-god. Legend has it that Alberic’s ancestor, Duke Marcus – one of the original Companions of Gilles the Uniter – himself fought alongside the temperamental sea god; apparently, the pair expelled raiders from Bordeleaux’s coastlines together, restoring peace and allowing trade to flourish once again unhindered.

Duke Alberic's bravery and strict self-discipline is well known, and naturally he expects his Knights to reach the same high personal standards, even going so far to dismiss and expel those who err or fail to meet them. This means that Alberic has the smallest Ducal household in the Kingdom, but one that is nevertheless a force to be reckoned with and containing some of Bretonnia’s greatest Knights. Unfortunately, circumstance has thus far prevented Alberic from achieving his life’s ambition – to embark upon a Grail Quest. For this to happen, a suitable successor must be found so that Bordeleaux may continue to flourish in his absence. Despite his advancing years, the Duke remains hopeful that a candidate may yet emerge, enabling him to leave his ancestral seat and search for the holy chalice of legend in the Lady’s blessed name!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_main_political_party_lzd_lord_mazdamundi	"The time of inaction is over. The great purpose must be accomplished."

The Lizardmen are the reptilian guardians of Order. They follow the Great Plan set down by the Old Ones, as interpreted by the Slann Mage-Priests who direct the small and capable Skinks, the Saurus Warriors, bestial Kroxigor and myriad other reptilian servants.

Being cold-blooded, Lizardmen reside in the warmer climates, mainly across the jungle-continent of Lustria and the Southlands. Hidden within the undergrowth are the temple-cities where the Slann contemplate and the other reptilian castes live to serve the Old Ones’ will. Shining brightest of all the ancient temple-cities is Hexoatl, the City of the Sun. Though Itza is the First City, Hexoatl has eclipsed it in importance due to its status as home to Lord Mazdamundi, the most active of all the remaining Slann Mage-Priests. Due to its location and history, the City of the Sun is the most fortified and martial of all the temple-cities. Whereas the boundaries of most other cities simply merge with the jungle, Hexoatl has mighty walls and serried ranks of Saurus patrol its plazas. Until recently, even the Norse trespassers of Skeggi and its surrounding colonies avoided Hexoatl, although that has changed of late.

Yet it is not just the city and its reptilian legions that enemies and invaders must be wary of, but its mighty leader, Lord Mazdamundi, oldest and most powerful of the living Slann Mage-priests; he who can bring ruination upon cities; he that rides the horned beast.

After years of contemplation, Mazdamundi has come to a simple epiphany: the Great Plan cannot move to the next phase until the first stage has been completed. This involves relocating a few, select races and the utter obliteration of the fell spawn that infests the world.

And so, with the fire of Old One, Chotec, burning within Lord Mazdamundi, the time of inaction is over – the Great Plan will be executed – order *will* come from Chaos, no matter the cost!	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_skv_tretch_craventail	The Skaven are the ratmen gnawing at the roots of the world – an evil and conniving race that outnumber all their enemies. If only they could stop squabbling and backstabbing for long enough, and join together in one mighty alliance, then all their enemies would be wiped out under a furry tide of screeching vermin.

But that is not how the Skaven think. Betrayal, duplicity, and cowardice are the true marks of the Skaven, and in many parts of the Under-Empire such traits are lauded as virtues. Clan Rictus vaunts these qualities – they are extremely rich, with treasure holds said to rival even those of Clan Mors. Rictus dominates the passages and tunnels under Crookback Mountain, a nest-lair deep in the Dark Lands to the east of the World's Edge. However, of late their focus has been pulled far to the west…

Tretch Craventail has no right to the title of Grand Chieftain of the Deep Warrens, and yet, none answer to it but he. The wretch has risen quickly through the ranks of Clan Rictus on a mixture of luck and outright, unashamed treachery. However, no Skaven can survive on luck alone, and so Tretch is also one of the most conniving and cruel ratmen to have lived in recent times. He has developed – or it was within him all along? – an absolute knack for knowing when lethal trouble is close. It’s at these times that Craventail will mysteriously disappear, leaving whichever retinue he was 'leading' to their inevitable fate.

But despite such a 'boon' – whether a natural talent or a gift from the Horned One himself – Tretch has finally come to the attention of Clan Rictus’ leader, Lord Kratch Doomclaw, a sitting member of the Council of Thirteen. Doomclaw has ordered Tretch lead a Clan Rictus expedition to the Elf-thing lands of Naggaroth, far to the west of Crookback Mountain. It is unclear exactly what Lord Kratch’s motives are but they're probably not altruistic in nature – maybe a play for power using his most capable Chieftains, or a way to rid himself of an annoying and potential rival? Most probably, it is both...	true

He left the seaport for the Colleges of Magic before the effects wore off, and now rumours abound that the swindled sea captain has placed a rich bounty on Balthasar’s head – though few would dare attempt to collect it.

The transmutation of common artefacts into precious metal has always fascinated Balthasar. Driven by his obsession, he spent many years combining his knowledge of alchemy, learnt in far-off lands, with the magical Lore of Metal. Balthasar’s fierce intelligence lent him a greater understanding of this branch of magic than any of his fellow students or tutors, and he rose quickly through the ranks of the Gold Order. Within a mere decade, Balthasar had become the Patriarch of the Golden College, the youngest wizard to ever hold the title.

Balthasar’s research into new formulations of black powder even made him popular with the Imperial Engineers School, an organisation that often dismisses magic as superstitious nonsense. However, during these studies, a freak explosion almost ended Balthasar’s quest for knowledge forever. Somehow he survived, and from that day on he has only ever been seen swathed in shimmering, metallic robes and wearing a golden face mask. Some say that beneath his mask his skin has turned to pure gold, while others whisper that he is horribly disfigured, though the truth of the matter is known only to Balthasar. One thing is certain: the accident only furthered his will to succeed, and this determination increased his powers to new heights. With a single gesture, Balthasar Gelt can transform his enemies into lifeless golden statues or turn their bones into molten iron. With such power at his command, Balthasar has secured victory for the Empire on numerous occasions.	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_political_party_hef_alarielle	Avelorn lies at the heart of Ulthuan and the Everqueen is its sovereign. Her realm is the principal site of the Earth Mother, and she is regarded as the spiritual leader of the entire Elven realm. The position of the Everqueen is always taken by the previous queen's firstborn daughter, conceived during her year-long ritual marriage to the Phoenix King. After this formal marriage, they are free to take fresh consorts, but only the daughter of the Phoenix King can be the new Everqueen. Hence the queens of Avelorn have always been the Everqueens of Ulthuan, forming an unbroken chain from ages past.

Avelorn itself is ancient. Its great forest is the oldest of all Elf realms. Ancient glamours lie upon its tangled groves, and creatures of legend - Treemen, Nymphs and Dryads - still walk beneath its eaves. It is a place of outstanding beauty and visceral danger to intruders, even the monsters that wander down from the Annulii mountains.

The court of the Everqueen is always on the move, travelling through Avelorn from place-to-place like a great carnival, pitching silken pavilions wherever it halts. By day, silver laughter rings through the forest as the Elves make sport. By night, faerie lights flicker in the darkness, illuminating the revels and feasting.

And yet, to mistake this Everqueen as merely a totem of the Earth Mother, Isha, would be unwise. She has a shrewd grasp of the political games played by Elven royals, and sends her own envoys to the courts - the Handmaidens - to ensure the good of all Ulthuan is upheld when such machinations are underway. And while Everqueens of the past may have avoided the battlefield, Alarielle the Radiant joins the fight without hesitation. Her power drawn from the hearts of all Asur, she is anathema to creatures of fell spirit, and no one can speak falsehood in her presence. So it is that a High Elf army might find glorious aid in its darkest hour, when the Radiant goes to war...	true

It was he, the eldest of the Treeman Ancients that first bound the spirits of the forest with the Children of Isha. For many seasons, the alliance was considered a good thing; the forest flourished and the Worldroots seeped deep underneath the land. Then, he bore witness to the rapacity of blooded life. He saw untold acres of trees felled and the Elves themselves invite countless calamities not only on their race, but on the greater forest realms as well. Now Durthu's patience has gone, replaced by anger and madness. Once a healer, now he is wrathful, making no distinction between the lost, the innocent and the wicked. The Elves are spared the Ancient's anger… for now at least, but he no longer considers them friends, only allies for common cause. And yet there are many foes wishing to trespass under the boughs of Athel Loren, forcing the ancient Treeman to fight with the Asrai, who respect Durthu still, even if he no longer cares for them.	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_vor_cst_sartosa_ruler	The most feared of all pirates who menace the waters surrounding the city-port of Sartosa and beyond is the ‘Queen of Tides’, Aranessa Anja Saltspite. Rumour has it that she was not sired by mortal man, but is actually the daughter of the Sea-God Manann, the ‘Seafather’ himself; that she rose fully grown out of the waves in a froth of gore, with seawater flowing through her veins instead of blood. Having been cast out by her Norscan tribe as a baby, she is said to have cut off her own fishtail before heading out to sea to seek her fortune, biding her time until she was strong enough – in every sense – to take her bloody revenge upon the people who left her for dead.

Whatever Aranessa’s origins, there can be no doubt that she is greatly favoured by the Sea-God, and that a peculiar connection exists between them, for she has sailed the Great Ocean to the very ends of the world and back, through the most violent of tempests, yet always emerges unscathed. Aranessa knows that it is her duty to protect the Seafather’s realm as he protects her, but the sea is vast, and such a task would take countless lifetimes, so Manann has granted her some of the world’s most powerful seafarers – Vampire Admirals, with whom he has made pacts in exchange for their aid. Aranessa is not entirely comfortable with this alliance, but knows her Necromantic officers are undeniably useful. As Manann washes the corpses of dead sailors against the Swordfysh’s hull and upon the shores of Sartosa, her allies breathe Unlife into them, thus fortifying her crew with shipmates Manann considers more ‘permanent’.

Associations with the Undead aside, those who have met Aranessa and lived say she is a strange character indeed. Peg-legged from her long career as a buccaneer, she has no warmth in her soul and absolutely no love for man. Only the open seas and the glitter of gems can melt her scowl, but as Aranessa’s crew maintain, on those rare occasions where she deigns to smile it is like a new dawn. But what manner of dawn? A dawn of merciless, cutthroat violence, theft and murder, which rages without end – that sort of dawn. Beholden to no man, be he living or dead, Captain Aranessa Saltspite – the self-styled ‘Pirate Queen’ – is every bit as merciless as the Great Ocean itself!	true

They were tired and hungry, but were Black Orcs nonetheless, and particularly hard ones at that. Even for a Black Orc, Grimgor’s thirst for war was exceptional. If a single day went by without a battle, Grimgor was known to start camp-decimating arguments, his one good eye blazing with eagerness to find fault and start a good scrap. Two days without a battle and Grimgor would smite anything he could reach, save (perhaps) his fellow Black Orcs. Who knows what would happen if three days without a battle ever occurred? Even scarred veterans tremble just to think of it. This unquenchable thirst for battle is a sign that marks out a Warboss for leadership, a sign that the Orc is favoured by Gork.

Reject false-words of seers and embrace true face of the Horned One! Bring Skrolk to the Wormstone, and you will be Plague Priest. Betray, and you become pus-bag."

Underneath the world lurks the Skaven - a race of noisome ratmen that despise all other things and desire world domination with every fibre of their twisted beings - from their quivering whiskers to the tips of their segmented tails.

Clan Pestilens is one of the four Greater Clans. Its members are the Plague Monks – the disciples of disease and decay. Clan Pestilens dedicate themselves with insane fervour to spreading corruption in the name of the Great Horned Rat. Pestilens was the first clan to reach Lustria; there, in the hot, fetid conditions, did the disease-ridden ratmen start to overcome the climate to found Clan Pestilens. It wasn’t long before the emergent clan encountered the Lizardmen and an age-old enmity was born. Of all the warm-blooded invaders to trespass on Lustria, it is the Skaven – and Clan Pestilens in particular – that the Lizardmen hate the most. Eventually, after decades of self-imposed exile, the Plague Monks re-joined the Under-Empire and immediately claimed their place on the Council of Thirteen. Their leader is Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch, and while he controls the clan from Skavenblight it is Lord Skrolk that remains in Lustria to return Pestilens to greatness.

Lord Skrolk is an affront to nature. Plants wither and die where Skrolk treads and even the air around him seems to congeal and darken. Skrolk is ancient and blind, but only a fool would mistake his lack of sight for weakness… In battle, Skrolk leads from the front so he can unleash his rabid fury, wielding the Rod of Corruption and reading from the Liber Bubonicus - a tome describing every disease conjured by Pestilens that even the Chaos God, Nurgle, is said to covet. But Skrolk’s greatest asset is and always will be his cunning. This Plague Priest has lived for countless centuries and is far more than a mere frenzied zealot!	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_cst_the_drowned_ruler	Cylostra Direfin is the vengeful spirit who commands the Lamprey, a cursed ship of rotten wood and tattered sails that oft appears out of the raging tempests of the open sea. Many decades ago, Cylostra was the favourite court singer of Bretonnian royalty, a prima donna of considerable size and with the proverbial ‘artistic temperament’ in spades, who never accepted anything less than having things all her own way. Her great volatility and intimidating demeanour meant that no-one ever dared refuse her demands.

Unfortunately for both Cylostra and ultimately the world, she was a passenger aboard the Lamprey during an important diplomatic voyage to perform for the Phoenix King. Amid a gale of truly epic proportions, the Bretonnian galleon went down in a violent electrical storm, drowning everyone on board, but as the legend goes, Cylostra had already usurped the ship’s meek captain before it sank, simply for daring to delay her performance by attempting to circumvent the dangerous weather! In a fit of rage, and demonstrating a near-unnatural physical strength born of her passion for music, she threw him overboard in what was, up to that point in her life, an uncharacteristic act of cold-blooded murder. Ordering the subjugated crew to keep the ship on course directly into the storm, Cylostra’s delusions of grandeur even made her believe that she could demand safe passage from the tempest itself by singing determinedly over the howling gales. Sadly, for her, the elements cannot so easily be tamed. As the Lamprey sank down beneath the waves, her futile, pitch-perfect notes turned to shrill, gurgled screaming.

Under normal circumstances, that would’ve been the end for most beings, but Cylostra’s bloated ego refused Morr’s embrace and she rose again in the ultimate act of diva-like defiance. Now, her tortured soul roams the seas, eternally searching for an appreciative audience. Those who know the legend of the ‘Siren of the Storm’ flee in terror at the sight of her ghostly, barnacle-strewn galleon, for it is said that when it appears with Cylostra singing upon its bow like a dreadful, Unliving figurehead, her songs of death paralyse all those unfortunate enough to hear them before her Undead crew – whom she refers to rather theatrically as ‘The Drowned’ – appear to drag them down into a watery grave, before they are raised again to join the Madame-Captain’s ratings for a life of unfettered piracy and murder!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_main_political_party_greenskins_azhag	On the face of it, Azhag is an unremarkable Warboss, though this is in the context where ‘unremarkable’ describes a class of hulking individuals who have pummelled their way to the top in a culture where only the strongest survive. All Orcs must fight to survive, but the tribes that dwell in Troll Country must endure particularly rigorous challenges. Monsters and packs of trolls stalk that deadly land, while Chaos warbands raid from the North. There is no safety amongst Orc kind, as the different tribes of Troll Country are bitter rivals, eager to destroy each other whenever they meet. Such are the lands in which Azhag rose to prominence.

Having established dominance over all competitors, he took control of his own mob and his exploits brought Greenskins flocking to his banner. Amongst these new followers were Shamans, both Goblin and Orc, and many of these have spoken of the strange and portentous aura that surrounds Azhag. Several have been visited with green-tinged visions in which Azhag sits astride a mighty Wyvern, an ominous iron crown on his brow from which an insistent voice whispers and mighty spells of Death emanate. If the Shamans are to be believed, Azhag has a mighty and terrible future ahead of him.	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_main_political_party_dwarf_grombrindal	For as long as there has been the Karaz Ankor, there has been the White Dwarf. Grombrindal is an enigmatic figure, recorded throughout the Dwarfs' history, appearing to give aid to his bearded kin whenever their situation becomes especially dire. However, what can one Dwarf do when a Karak is besieged by thousands of Greenskins, or a Dwarf throng surrounded and outnumbered by a warherd of braying, ravenous Beastmen? In Grombrindal’s case, turns out he can do quite a lot; the White Dwarf is a mighty warrior, some say bettered only by Grimnir himself. Every slash of his legendary axe sees the heads of urks tumble from their dishonourable shoulders. Grombrindal has faced armies of thousands on his own and won, which is why many believe him to be a living Ancestor.

According to the bards he was - and maybe still is - the lover of the venerated hearth goddess Valaya. Grombrindal himself is never drawn on such a vulgar subject, even when the beer starts to flow during the inevitable post-battle feasts. This matters little to most Dwarfs, who are just grateful to have fought beside such a legend and lived to tell of his deeds and achievements on the battlefield. Long before most other Dwarfs have sobered, the White Dwarf dons his hooded cloak and wanders away into the night - for there are always more Dawi to aid, more urks to slay!	true

More than a mere brutal Beastlord, he is bestowed with an intellect far superior to that of his peers. The One-Eye has a deep understanding of his followers, able to channel the unruly nature of the herd and corral his Gors by harnessing their wild nature. Not every true-horn is worthy of Khazrak's retinue; inferior tribes will come, Gors from across the Drakwald, drawn by the One-Eye's dark reputation and hoping to share in his despicable spoils. But Khazrak's success means he can afford to be choosy, and so only those Cloven Ones he deems worthy are offered a place by his side. Those that are turned down may well be sent on their way unmolested, others that Khazrak deems as a threat - perhaps bitter at their rejection - will not leave the immediate area alive. With the One-Eye able to be selective, Khazrak retains a fearsome grip upon his army - a wild force that enacts his cunning and effective plans with murderous efficiency. No one is spared during Khazrak's attacks, his superbly-trained Warhounds easily chasing down the few who manage to escape the warherd's trap.	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_def_lokhir_fellheart_ruler	From the forbidding, blackened towers of their sprawling dread city-port Karond Kar, the Dark Elves – or Druchii, as they are called in the Elven tongue – wile away their extremely long lives indulging in internecine plots, twisted schemes, depraved, debauched acts of all kinds, and of course wanton cruelty, sickening torture and bad, old-fashioned death. With devotions such as these, you would think that a life of adventure on the perilous high seas of the Great Ocean – endlessly fighting, raiding and plundering, at great personal risk – would be far too much like hard work for the hedonistic Druchii. Yet there are some among their number who eschew the decadent lifestyles of their peers, throwing caution, and themselves, to the wind, quite literally.

Of course, for many the intention is to escape the dangers of Naggarothi life, where execution or murder, always accompanied by a smile, if not maniacal laughter, are always close by, if not waiting around the next corner. Not so in the case of Lokhir Fellheart – the dreaded ‘Krakenlord’. He was born to ply the rolling seas, bringing death to those stupid enough to attempt to traverse them, and fire, terror and enslavement to unsuspecting foreign shores. Countless ports and coastal cities lie ruined and ablaze in his wake, for Fellheart is the latest in a long line of doom-bringing admirals to command the Black Ark known as the Tower of the Blessed Dread.

As a result of his terrible exploits, Fellheart has accumulated much plunder – wealth beyond measure, in fact – along with far greater glory than all of his forebears combined. More treasure flows through Karond Kar than ever before – of both the shiny sort and the fleshy, enslaved kind – earning him the grudging respect, if not quite the trust, of the city-port’s Dreadlord masters. But that is enough for Fellheart, for he cares little for politics or anything much except loot and plunder and what it can buy him – the loyalty of his Corsairs and the lavish bribes he pays to insalubrious officials that enable him to operate freely. Although he keeps the best pieces for himself, Fellheart is admired by his crew for his generosity, a quality not normally associated with Dark Elves! They also trust him due to the personal courage he displays in battle, a dangerous habit that other Druchii admirals tend to lose as soon as they can, lest their days on account upon the Great Ocean be very few in number!

It is certainly true that the privations of sea-life, including his high-pressure command, have done little to blunt Lokhir Fellheart’s swordplay – he fights as naturally as he reads the oceans. Well aware that the loyalties of pirate crews hold only as long as their captain’s reputation, Fellheart relentlessly slays enemy heroes, tossing their severed heads onto an ever-growing pile, knowing full well that every skull adds another page to the book of his legend and gives mutineers more than a few compelling reasons not to cross swords with their captain!	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_political_party_def_hellebron	The Dark Elves were once Asur, the same race as the High Elves. What separates them is that the Druchii unleashed their minds from the iron discipline that all Elves require else they slip into depravity. The Druchii opened their hearts to the gods of the Cytharai, the Elven gods of the Underworld.

Of all the underworld gods it was Khaine, God of Murder, who rose to prominence, and especially in Har Ganeth - the City of Executioners. It is a cursed place. A madness overtook that city long ago, a thirst for blood and flesh that has just been kept in abeyance by some of the strictest laws in all Naggaroth. Only in Har Ganeth are acts such as murder, thievery, and public debauchery treated as crimes. The penalty for any infraction is, of course, death by execution. This is a heavy burden to bear for a folk with such a proclivity for violence and homicide; but that is the point, for the slightest leeway would lead to utter depravity and the madness taking hold again.

The release for all this pent-up, violent aggression comes on Death Night, an eve of bloody excess in Khaine's glorious name. As soon as the sun sets, so do the city's draconian laws, and all hell breaks loose as Witch Elves, nobles and even slaves take to the streets to revel in murder. Scores are settled and new ones created in a night of diabolical violence. And only as the dawn gong rings out across the city, and the sated survivors attempt to flee the street, does Har Ganeth’s ruler make an appearance. The gates to the palace swing open and Hellebron, accompanied by her elite guard, emerges to sweep the streets of those engorged and slow with the night’s excesses.

Hellebron is the Blood Queen, High Priestess of Khaine and most powerful of all Witch Elves. Her only true rival in power is Morathi, whom she despises. For the Witch King’s mother has withheld the secret of eternal youth from Hellebron. And so, while Morathi keeps her eldritch beauty, time leeches upon Hellebron. She becomes a withered crone, and only by bathing in Cauldrons of Blood can she temporarily restore her youthful aspect. But every year, the enchantment wears off quicker and more blood is required. It is this constant attainment to a lost and fleeting beauty that drives the Blood Queen ever onward...	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_cst_noctilus_ruler	The immortal Vampire Counts of Sylvania – known to most as the Midnight Aristocracy – seldom venture from the comfort of their dank castles and certainly very few have been known to leave their fell feeding grounds for the uncertain life of the sea-borne adventurer. Nyklaus von Carstein, therefore, is something of an anomaly among his kind…

 The infamous fleet commander now known as Count Noctilus is leader of the Dreadfleet – a malevolent gathering of dissolute (and desiccated) Undead warship captains, including notorious privateers such as the Shadewraith, the Skabrus, the Black Kraken and the Curse of Zandri, among others, who bring abject ruin to the high seas and damnation to living seafarers. Although once a member of Sylvania’s aristocratic Vampire dynasty, he had a markedly different vision from his squabbling peers of how he would achieve Necromantic supremacy. After studying the countless charts which map the ebb and flow of magic across the world, von Carstein realised that by mastering the art of seafaring he would be able to harness the magical gales that whirl and cascade across the oceans.

 This newfound route to power eventually led him to translocate himself and his Undead minions to the bone-choked morass of the Galleon’s Graveyard, a fell sea-based realm of the Unliving between the tangible and intangible worlds that entraps shipwrecked vessels from across the Great Ocean. It was in this mysterious place that Nyklaus von Carstein founded his darkling empire and renamed himself Count Noctilus.

At the centre of the Galleon’s Graveyard, Noctilus has feasted upon the magic of a sentient whirlpool known as the Maelstrom – a skull-strewn tempest of magic that sucks in shipwrecks, plunder, and drowned sailors from beyond the veil like a giant lodestone. By using the whirlpool’s raw power to draw in the shattered remains of dead warships, he has forged a grotesque seafaring vessel of his own – the Bloody Reaver, an amalgam of rotting galleons and eldritch power upon which sits the dark and jagged crag of his floating castle, standing proudly like a conqueror’s statue! 

As the clock strikes midnight, the Dreadfleet heads out to sea, its Undead captains eager to slake their unholy thirsts. Their warships of the damned emerge from banks of sulphurous fog, illuminated only by flickering, pallid ghostlights, drawing closer with the sickening slowness of a recurring nightmare before the silence is broken by the thunderous roar of their lethal broadsides! After each raid, the Dreadfleet disappears back into its watery lair as quickly and silently as it first appeared, far from the reach of the living.	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_main_political_party_def_morathi	"They will betray you, my son, they always do. Let me end them first."

All Elves were once as one, living in contentment in their island paradise of Ulthuan. Alas, nothing endures forever. The Daemons came and Aenarion strode forth to vanquish them. At first a mighty hero… then he drew the Sword of Khaine and doomed his line.

The Daemons were banished, the Great Vortex created, but in victory came the Elves’ ultimate defeat. A schism was rent between those who had been most loyal to Aenarion’s line, and the rest of Ulthuan. Soon Elf fought Elf and the Dark Elves, or, more accurately, the Druchii, were forged in war, blood and murder. The events that led to this sundering happened millennia ago, and yet, the grand architect of a whole race’s tragedy not only still lives but remains one of the most powerful of all their rulers. She is the mother of the Witch King; she is Morathi, the Hag Sorceress of Ghrond.

Morathi was Aenarion’s second wife. He rescued the beautiful seeress from a Slaaneshi host. As the legends tell it, they soon fell in love, and Morathi’s influence became absolute. Through their union came a son, Malekith, destined to become the Witch King. This alone guarantees Morathi a place in history, but she is far more than a mother alone. It was Morathi that broke apart the magical spectrum to fashion Dark Magic. It was she that spread the Cult of Pleasure throughout Ulthuan, fermenting the seeds of discord and ensuring that Malekith’s followers were ready when he made his move against the usurpers of Ulthuan.

To this day, Morathi is both revered and hated by her own kin. While the Witch King tolerates his mother, she is more likely to be manipulating events that furnish her own agenda. Seduction and assassination are her favoured weapons, although she is no stranger to open war. Over millennia the Cult of Pleasure’s influence has waxed and waned, but it has always remained under Morathi’s sway. And so - even as Malekith banishes the Hag Sorceress away from the traditional powerbase of Ghrond to the Ancient City of Quintex - her followers are ready and waiting.	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_vampire_coast_ruler	Piracy was not Luthor Harkon’s initial career choice. The Vampire, whose origins are shrouded in mystery, was travelling in his sarcophagus across the Great Ocean, aboard an Empire merchant ship, when it was attacked by a band of savage Norscan raiders. Unfortunately for them, in their rabid scramble for loot they prised open Harkon’s burial chest, awakening him from his dreamless slumber. By the time the ship broke up on the rocky Lustrian coastline, all the ‘surviving’ crew had undergone something of a change, in both their allegiance and their vital signs…

Since that day, Harkon has ruled the region now known as the Vampire Coast, setting sail upon the Great Ocean in search of loot, plunder, and fresh recruits to raise into his service. As leader of a pirate fleet crewed exclusively by the dead and damned, he holds sway over a sea region of high winds and perilous currents that have proven to be incredibly treacherous to many unwary vessels, swelling his horde of Undead mariners with the reanimated corpses of shipwrecked unfortunates.

Luthor Harkon teeters constantly on the very brink of insanity due in no small part to his colossal pride and greed, qualities which on one devastating, fateful occasion led him to almost lose his life as well as his mind, and certainly lost him all of his magical abilities short of the power to raise his minions and bind them to his inexorable will. The story goes that, while on a fateful quest to further augment his already not-inconsiderable might, Harkon attempted to use his Dark Magic to enter a chamber inside a Lizardman temple buried deep within the deadly Lustrian jungle. Powerful glyphs barred his way, but he pushed onwards in spite of the barriers and driven by his fatal flaw – his great arrogance and hubris - causing the magical seals to retaliate and drain his magical power and then his lifeforce, whilst the walls of the ancient ritual chamber began to crumble. With supreme effort, Harkon managed to break free and stagger outside as the passageway collapsed behind him, but the damage had been done – his connection to the Winds of Magic was severed and his mind was shattered, leaving his personality fractured into a dozen different facets which to this day battle for dominance in his mind.

In the years since, the only common goal that Luthor Harkon’s various personalities have been able to work towards is that of finding a cure for his condition. To this end, the Pirate King of the Vampire Coast has bent his obsessions to seizing Slann artefacts in the hope that their power can heal his damaged psyche!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc04_political_party_empire_volkmar	Volkmar the Grim is both leader and spiritual head of the Cult of Sigmar. He is a pious and foreboding man dedicated to the destruction of evil, whether it takes the form of Chaos or the rotting darkness of Unlife. He is no cleric hiding away from what he decries, nor a priest more content with the wealth and status such a position brings - an accusation that has been justifiably levied at Grand Theogonists in the past. Sigmar was a warrior in life and a god to fighters upon his ascension, so His clergy follow their Lord’s example - none more so than Volkmar the Grim. He has fought in countless battles, both on and off the War Altar of Sigmar - a mobile shrine of divine power. When Volkmar fights, the men of the Empire are encouraged by the sight that Sigmar’s holy representative smiting His foes in their midst.

As well as a warrior and pious Cult leader, Volkmar is a strong ally of Karl Franz. In fact it was their alliance that gave Franz the three votes he needed to beat Boris Todbringer’s candidacy, thus suggesting that amidst the fire and wrath there is a shrewdness to Volkmar - something that many in the courts of Altdorf and Middenheim do not give him credit for. However, this has agitated relations between the Cult of Sigmar and Middenland, especially with the Ar-Ulric, the religious leader of Ulric’s cult. Hence, there is a need for a strong Emperor on the throne, someone with a powerful congregation of Sigmar’s chosen at his side.	true

Long ago, the near-immortal Elves were a single race, united in outlook. Then came a great divide, when avarice, jealousy and malevolence boiled over and forever tore apart their civilisation. Denied the throne and then rejected by the god Asuryan’s purifying flames, Malekith, rightful son of Aenarion, has declared himself forever the enemy of Ulthuan and the Asur.

Although Malekith’s broken body was healed by his mother, the Hag Sorceress Morathi, using magical means, he remains scarred from the encounter and twisted by an inalienable desire to avenge himself upon those once considered kin. There are none among the Druchii – Malekith’s Elven supporters – who have seen his face, for his entire body lies encased within a suit of enchanted, black-metal armour said to be fused to his flesh. Many among the Druchii even mutter that Morathi’s Dark Magic has rendered her son immortal. Whether or not this is true, Malekith promises dire vengeance upon the Asur, vowing to wipe Ulthuan forever from the face of the world if he is denied the Phoenix Throne again.

Deep within the Dark Elves’ bleak kingdom of Naggaroth, plans are afoot to bring about the High Elves’ downfall. To this end, Malekith has spent centuries training to become the perfect warrior, a much-dreaded sorcerer, and an ‘inspirational’ leader, although fear of the ‘Witch King’, as he is now known is, in many cases, the galvanising element.

 Malekith’s forces have followed him across the world in pursuit of his dark goal, and have faced the High Elves on many occasions; in spite of this, Ulthuan still stands. Nothing if not persistent, Malekith knows that soon there will be a final reckoning between the Elves – the Druchii will rise, the Asur will fall, and the work of millennia will at last be complete. If the Witch King cannot rule Ulthuan, then no one will!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc04_political_party_vampire_helman	Originally the youngest of five strong brothers from Templehof, Ghorst was a farrier and groom just like his father. His love of danger and the open road meant he would make any excuse to deliver messages to Ulfheim or Vassel. One day, he returned from his adventures to find his brothers and father dead in their beds, taken by the ravaging Plague of Blue Roses. Fungus-bruises covered their bodies, and its spores were thick in the air. Ghorst could not accept their loss. At first he tried to embrace his lost brothers, but the plague would not take him - fate had other designs for Helman Ghorst! Eventually he plunged himself into the study of the black arts, hoping to return his brothers to life.

From that moment on, Ghorst was far from the good-natured farrier’s son, instead being marked for a much darker destiny. In studying the black arts, he lost himself to forbidden lore and communed with dread things. Driven by far more than the lust for power, but a deep personal grief, he went further than many other Necromancer had previously dared. Such ambition, combined with a wilful lack of self-preservation for his own soul, drew the attention of Mannfred von Carstein, another driven by familial bonds, though ones far different in nature. In Ghorst, Mannfred found a willing puppet, a servant whose loyalty he could easily buy; in Mannfred, Ghorst saw a master of Necromantic lore, who could bring his brothers back to full Unlife, if he himself proved worthy.	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_political_party_vor_hef_alith_anar	Legend has it that, when Malekith fled into the west, the folk of Nagarythe chose Alith Anar as their ruler. The new king was the last heir of a great line, his forebears slain by the Witch King’s minions. In those days there were many Dark Elves still hiding in Ulthuan, and Alith Anar took to eradicating them with a vengeance. Foes not killed in battle were crucified on trees or had their skin stretched across the ragged cliff-faces, where those who passed could witness the insurgents' grisly fate. As Anar attacked and burned each enemy encampment, his infamy grew. He and his loyal warriors struck from the darkness to purge their homeland of traitors and those sympathetic to Malekith. And so the Legend of the Shadow King grew. 

To this day, Anar carries a bleak outlook, one which matches the lands over which he reigns, as the Shadowlands, Nagarythe, are dark and desolate places. Nagarythe's jagged coast still bears the scars of the Sundering, yet it is seen as home by the tough, seasoned Shadow Warriors who look upon their kin in the other nine kingdoms with nothing short of utter disdain.

Anar himself is a king without a palace, not that he desires a luxurious throne. One of the greatest Elven palaces of all, Anlec, was once capital of Nagarythe and the seat of the first Phoenix king. Now, it lies in ruins, but there have been many attempts by the Druchii and even some Asur to bring it back to past glories. The Shadow King, however, is more comfortable with his warriors in the wilds or even ranging beyond Nagarythe’s borders, to fulfil his eternal quest for vengeance against the traitor-kin who ruined his homeland and slaughtered his bloodline!	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_tmb_arkhan	In the Land of the Dead, no name is more hated than Nagash the Arch-Necromancer, architect of Nehekhara’s downfall. It was he that cast a great ritual and brought all the dead back to Unlife ahead of the promised Day of Awakening. Centuries before this epochal moment, he had ruled Khemri, stealing the kingship from his younger brother.

Arkhan was the most loyal of Nagash’s followers, pivotal in the coup that brought the nascent Necromancer to power. After his lord, Arkhan was the first to imbibe the Elixir of Life, thereby transitioning from mere mortal to Unliving immortal. For decades, Arkhan remained staunchly loyal to Nagash; a great warrior and general, he was also an accomplished student of dark sorcery thanks to his master's teachings. After fifty years of rule, the other cities of Nehekhara revolted against Nagash – desperate to end his malicious reign. The Army of the Seven Kings besieged Khemri, and Nagash was forced to retreat. Arkhan held back the allied Priest Kings’ legions through feats both martial and arcane. He finally fell, not to some hero’s blade but an ordinary spear thrown by a nameless soldier. By his dying breath he cursed both the spear and any that desecrated his corpse.

Nagash has returned to enact vengeance on Nehekhara several times over the centuries. One of the Arch-Necromancer's first acts was to resurrect his faithful lieutenant. And so Arkhan the Black, the Liche King, rose from the dead, as loyal as always and a key figure in Nagash’s many machinations. In an age of comets and new empires, Nagash remains adrift from the world… for the moment. But he is very much active. Arkhan's Black Tower a beacon for those who worship the Arch-Necromancer as a god-in-waiting. Naturally, his greatest rival – everyone's greatest rival no less – is Settra the Imperishable. The two have fought dozens of times; although Arkhan’s forces cannot rival Settra’s legions, neither can the Imperishable overcome the Liche King’s dark sorcery. Thus, their wars end in stalemate, and only when Arkhan utters false promises of fealty does Settra return satisfied to Khemri. Such false servitude cannot – will not – last, for while there is still a chance to resurrect Nagash, his loyal servant will take it.	true

To the south of the world, in much warmer, jungle climes, live the Lizardmen. These reptilian champions of Order are not one race but a collective of various cold-blooded creatures all dedicated to bringing the Great Plan of the Old Ones – the stellar race that terraformed the world before the Ancient Enemy brought ruin – to fruition.

The Lizardmen are led by the Slann Mage-Priests, who in turn are served by the adaptable Skinks, the labouring Kroxigor and the fearsome warrior-caste, the mighty Saurus. It is the Saurus that form the bulk of the Lizardmen armies for they are spawned for that sole purpose – bringing war to those deigned as enemies by the Mage-Priests.

Just because the Saurus have no concerns beyond battle does not mean they are limited in intellect. Far from it, in fact, for they excel in the role for which they are specifically spawned. None among their number is more capable or feared by the warmbloods than Kroq-Gar, Last Defender of Xhotl. Kroq-Gar is an Ancient Scar-Leader and a legendary presence amongst the Lizardmen, for he has fought Daemons and countless enemies over untold millennia.

Unquestioningly, Kroq-Gar was blessed by the Old Ones during his spawning, for he was among the last survivors of Xhotl, a temple-city that suffered constant Daemonic attack during the Great Cataclysm. After the loss of his home temple-city, he continued to fight; master-less, he and his Saurus Warriors ranged far across the jungles seeking out foes and interlopers, of which there are many.

In recent centuries, Kroq-Gar has fallen under the sway of Lord Mazdamundi. The great second generation Mage-Priest recognised in him an eternal warrior spirit and gifted him the Hand of Gods, a relic of the Old Ones. Strategically positioned for the coming wars, Mazdamundi has sent Kroq-Gar and his loyal cohorts across the World Pond to the Southlands. The Last Defender has been tasked with re-establishing the failing Geomantic Web and bringing about the next stage of the Great Plan: the annihilation of the myriad enemies of Order.	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_tmb_settra	In the land of Nehekhara, Khemri was the greatest city, ruled over by a dynasty of cruel kings and tyrants. While Nagash’s stolen rule of Khemri is indeed noteworthy, none – apart from the Arch-Necromancer himself – can question that its utmost reign came under High King Settra.

Before the wind of death ravaged Nehekhara, it was an impressive civilisation, a burgeoning realm of rival fiefdoms that saw mankind expand long before Sigmar was even born. But the curse of man, compared to Dwarfs and Elves, is their fleeting existence. Soon the kings and princes of the city-states became obsessed with death, with extending their meagre span. The Mortuary Cult was formed during Settra’s reign and charged with ensuring that mortal bonds would not halt his rule. Settra passed with a curse upon his lips, buried in a grand chamber beneath his mighty pyramid to await the Day of Awakening, when the Mortuary Cult will fulfil their promise and Settra will rise to rule Khemri and dominate all the kingdoms along the Great River Vitae once again. Only modest progress in extending life was made until the rise of Nagash, for it was he who was destined to become the first and greatest of all Necromancers – he who truly brought Unlife to the world.

The tale of Nagash is terrible to behold; needless to say, he was banished from Khemri – and thought destroyed – but many years later rose again and enacted his revenge on all Nehekhara. He cast a great ritual and all the dead in the city-states rose from their ageless slumbers. But this was not the glorious Day of Awakening promised by the Mortuary Cult. The kings awoke entombed in their sarcophagi, breaking free of their burial chambers they saw through empty eye sockets. They had not woken as gods, but were still the rotting mummies that had withered inside their tombs for countless centuries. Some went insane, others remain in denial, but a few were filled with rage at this betrayal. None more so than Settra.

Now Settra the Imperishable rules Khemri once more. His Undead legions march at his whim; the King of Kings will not rest until all are under his dominance, be they other, petty Tomb Kings, or the living, whom he despises, for they have something he can never again possess.	true

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_tmb_khatep	Even when they lived, the Tomb Kings of Nehekhara – or Priest Kings as they were – were obsessed with death. It infuriated them that the gods had seen fit to only grant them just a few short decades upon the world to make their mark and none rankled under that knowledge more than the Great King Settra.

Despite having conquered all Nehekhara and ensuring that much of Khemri was made in his image, Settra was obsessed with not just creating a legacy, but outliving it. And so he ordered the Mortuary Cult formed – its purpose to discover the ultimate secret: to cheat death. The Priesthood of the Mortuary Cult was led by Khatep, an extremely gifted and wise seer. It was Khatep who tended to Settra’s dying mortal form and promised the Great King that he would rise again on the Day of Awakening. As the years past, the hieratic cult’s quest for lore was partially successful. The priests themselves learnt how to sustain a form of Unlife, their spirits tethered to their desiccated bodies, yet the knowledge to bring back the kings as eternal demi-gods still lay beyond their grasp. However, they were undeterred and their search continued, all while serving their living kings as advisors and viziers. Thus, the Mortuary Cult spread across Nehekhara.

The arrival of the Arch-Necromancer changed everything. Following the casting of Nagash’s Great Ritual, civil war threatened Nehekhara and Khatep took it upon himself to restore order. He broke open the seals to Settra’s Grand Pyramid, which caused the Great King to rise, filled with an unquenchable wrath. However, Settra had not risen as a beatific sovereign but as a ravaged mummy – this was not the Day of Awakening promised by the Mortuary Cult! Settra raged and banished Khatep from Khemri.

To this day Khatep the Liche Lord remains the nominal head of the Mortuary Cult; since his exile he wanders the world, at first restricted to roaming Nehekhara's vast deserts, but of late he has travelled further afield, gathering followers and fellow exiles to seek out the lost lore he hopes will return the Lands of Nehek to glory and rehabilitate his reputation as their saviour!	true

The High Elves – or Asur as they call themselves – are among the oldest civilisations in the world; possibly, only the jungle-dwelling Lizardmen can lay claim to a longer existence. Although mortal, Elves lead incredibly long lives; so long, in fact, that the spans allotted to men seem to be as fleeting as those of mayflies. From their island fortress-paradise of Ulthuan near the centre of the world, the High Elves – although aloof and arrogant in their manner – have generally walked the path of Order, using their longevity to become warriors without peer and mages without equal.

As descendants of Aenarion, the first Phoenix King, the twin brothers Tyrion and Teclis were marked for greatness from the moment they were born, like all of his line. Whereas Tyrion is renowned for his martial excellence, Teclis, who could not hope to match his brother’s physical prowess, instead became a magic-user of no small note. Widely considered to be the most powerful sorcerer of the age and one of the greatest ever to walk the world, there are few, if any, capable of defeating him in a duel, not even the vengeance-obsessed Dark Elf Witch King, Malekith.

Unlike his brother, who considers the defence of the High Elf kingdom of Ulthuan his chief duty, Teclis has a care for the whole world and sees it as his duty to prevent it falling into the hands of the Ruinous Powers. It is this generosity of spirit that has seen the High Elves allied with such disparate races as the men of the Empire and the Lizardmen of Lustria, impacting the former to the extent that the Empire’s fabled Colleges of Magic would never have existed if it was not for Teclis’ wise counsel and tuition in magical matters. Such is his renown, Teclis – the Loremaster of Hoeth and Warden of the White Tower – casts a shadow so lengthy that his influence will be felt right across the world long after his death.	true
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_tmb_khalida	Beyond the Badlands lies the Land of the Dead. This desert realm is the cradle of mankind’s earliest empire – a civilisation known as Nehekhara that did not just huddle the banks of the Great Vitae River, but straddled the mountains to reach the shores of the Bitter Sea.

To the east, it was dominated by the cities of Lahmia, Mahrak and Lybaras – ruled by great matriarchs. Even so, Khemri remained its greatest prize. When Nagash, the Arch-Necromancer, was defeated by the Army of the Seven Kings, High Queen Neferata of Lahmia acted quickly, even as the alliance dissipated. In secret, she stole the forbidden lore of Nagash to recreate the Elixir of Life. But Neferata’s own concoction was flawed – it did indeed extend her life, but the cost was an unyielding thirst for blood. Neferata had unwittingly created a race that would blight all the world forever more, she became the first Vampire.

By the time her cousin, Khalida of Lybaras, visited for a great feast, most of the Lahmian Court were infected with Vampirism. To display her new found power, Neferata challenged her cousin to ritual combat in front of all in attendance. The two women fought before the shocked nobility, their blades weaving a deadly and delicate dance. But Neferata was no longer a mere mortal, and so bested her cousin. As Khalida lay dying, Neferata let her own cursed blood infect the Lybaran queen, as a final, spiteful act. The Warrior-Queen cried to the gods in desperation, and one answered! The Asp-Goddess heard Khalida's pleas and purged the taint from her veins, at the cost of her life. Khalida’s body was borne back to Lybaras in sorrow, where she was embalmed and placed upon her throne, ready to defend her city and godly patron from behind the wall of death.

When the Tomb Kings finally awoke from their breathless sleep, Khalida remained on her throne, uninterested in the power-grabbing and politicking of these Undying tyrants. However, when Lybaras is threatened, Khalida acts, and quickly. At Asaph's bidding, she silently rises from her throne and commands her loyal legions to march forth. Khalida fights not merely out of loyalty to the goddess who aided her, she harbours a deep, eternal loathing – not just for her cousin, but all Vampires who dare cross her path.	true

But Kemmler has always coverted power beyond anything else, and this time the Forces of Order will not stop him - the dead will rise and the world will fall!	true

We will emerge victorious and more intractable than ever to these turbulent times when our corrupt brothers come to ravage our shores. We are the Asur, the sons of Aenarion and Ulthuan shall never fall."

The ancient High Elves have long stood guard over the world, ensuring it remains in balance – Daemonic efforts of hordes of Chaos and the foolish meddling of younger, ‘lesser’ races notwithstanding. Known among their kind as the Asur, the High Elves are both conceited and detached, no doubt due to their immense longevity and the comparative isolation of their island kingdom of Ulthuan, which forces such a worldview to a great extent. Whereas in other races such traits could prove fatal, in the Asur’s case they are assets, for the Elves have used them to attain knowledge and skills in magic and war that far outstrip those of almost all their historical adversaries.

Now, there is one among the Asur – a warrior so great that he has yet to meet his match with a blade: Prince Tyrion, Heir of Aenarion and Defender of Ulthuan. So impressive are Tyrion’s martial talents, so perfectly does he combine skill-at-arms with speed of thought, that there are many among the Asur who consider him to be both the world’s greatest living warrior and the reincarnation of the first Phoenix King, Aenarion, said to be reborn and living again through the young prince.

Unswervingly loyal to the current Phoenix King, Finubar, and the Everqueen, Alarielle, Tyrion discharges his duty as Ulthuan’s defender with the utmost seriousness, spending much of his time building up and training the High Elves’ armies into a fighting force with few equals, if any. 

There are also many entries in the Asur’s Book of Days that stand testament to the prince’s personal bravery – during the cataclysmic Battle of Finuval Plain, against his arch enemy, the Witch King Malekith, and his Dark Elf forces, Prince Tyrion even rescued the Everqueen from the battlefield, and has remained her consort and closest advisor ever since.	true

Queek will show the whole world that Queek is the mightiest, the best, the most deadly! We will see what Gnawdwell says about orders then."

The Skaven are vile, malevolent ratmen that swarm beneath the surface of the world. Hidden in their sprawling underground lairs, they gnaw at the roots of civilisation, plotting and scheming for the day they will burst from their dark tunnels and drown the world above in a tide of mangy fur, rusty blades and plague-ridden filth.

The Skaven Under-Empire consists of countless clans. Each one – just like each individual Skaven – jostles for position, status and power. The four Greater Clans are unassailable in this never-ending race, but under them, the Warlord Clans are a thriving mass of betrayal and broken alliances. Clan Mors is currently the most powerful, their ascendancy in no small part due to their control of the City of Pillars – the lower levels of Karak Eight Peaks and an important nexus of the Under-Empire. While the grand ruler of Clan Mors, Warlord Gnawdwell, takes his seat on the Council of Thirteen in the ratmen capital of Skavenblight, the City of Pillars falls under Gnawdwell’s infamous ‘Right Claw’: Queek Headtaker.

The scarlet-armoured, fur-clad warrior of rage and ego is Queek Headtaker - scion of Clan Mors and one of the most accomplished and fierce fighters in all Skavendom. He is despised by Dwarfs for the sheer amounts of heads he has taken, with a record number of entries in the Great Book of Grudges, but he is also hated by Greenskins and Elves too. The only thing more renowned than Queek’s fighting prowess is his arrogance. The Headtaker is a power-hungry narcissist who carries the severed heads of his latest victims upon his trophy rack, advertising to enemies and followers just how truly great he is.

While Queek has carved quite the powerbase under Eight Peaks, Gnawdwell sends him wherever Clan Mors needs him to be. The Council of Thirteen - of which Gnawdwell is a part - see Headtaker as a powerful asset to enable their plans, whether Queek agrees with them or not!	true
