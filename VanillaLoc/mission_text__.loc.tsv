mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_empire_3_main_heading	As Magnus Did So Shall We 	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_1_5_description	Pestilens was born amongst the pox marshes and swamps of eastern Lustria, and despite its inhospitable climate, it is where they call home. They shall retain this homeland, in the name of the Great Horned Rat.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_2_5_description	The jungles of Lustria are teeming with foul disease and humid corruption. It is here that Clan Pestilens found their purpose, and it is here that they will continue their quest in the name of the Great Horned Rat.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_3_5_description	Lustria is a perfect ecosystem for the needs of Clan Pestilens - every foul swamp is teeming with new and interesting diseases, and every feverish day beats down a relentless heat, incubating and nurturing any potential illnesses.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_4_5_description	There are others who would claim the jungles as their own - the Lizardmen, proud and suspicious creates, prowl their ruined temples and 'sacred' jungles. But Clan Pestilens is charged with duty by the Great Horned Rat - none can stand in their way.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_5_5_description	Not content with the swamps in which they started, the ratmen of Clan Pestilens have decided that the entire Great Jungle must be theirs. Every fetid swamp and humid, squelching mire must belong to them - everything pungent must be Pestilens!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_1_4_description	Clan Pestilens has one goal; the spread of corruption and disease in the name of the Great Horned Rat. That they are ill-regarded even by their own ratkin is irrelevant, for their duty is to the Horned One, not the petty chittering nuisance of the Skaven.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_2_4_description	The Skaven mind is a curious thing; cunning rats capable of cunning things. The engineers of the ratmen are proficient at creating unusual weapons of vast destruction, from Jezzails, to Doom-Flayers, to the truly terrifying Warp Lightning Cannon, hurling destruction across the battlefield.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_3_4_description	Every bubo is a badge of honour to Clan Pestilens; the Plague Priests are held aloft as the ideal; they have converted themselves wholesale to the incubation of filth. Their skin festers and broils under the weight of disease, pus-filled sores telling of the glory they have nurtured.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_4_4_description	Only the strongest rats in a Skaven clan rise to be leader. But strength is not determined by physical prowess alone. Indeed, often the most cunning and devious Warlords remain alive by staying five steps ahead of their rivals.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_5_4_description	For all that they are reviled by others, Clan Pestilens is nevertheless contracted by other Warlords when their services are required. Whether they accept or not, however, depends not on coin, but whether the service provides an opportunity to further spread disease.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_1_1_description	The rats of Clan Pestilens are bound by one purpose, given to them specifically by the Great Horned Rat. To this end, they will rise above the Under-Empire and to the land of men, and their corruption will overflow to the very ends of the world.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_2_1_description	The Skaven have a plan, and that plan will be achieved by any means necessary. In darkened, festering corners, the Skaven Plague Priests chant their invocations, summoning great catastrophe upon the world with their words.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_3_1_description	Clan Pestilens dreams of a future where the world is drowned in filth and detritus, swamping the lands of man and their glittering towers. They will all fall to disease; none shall be left standing but Pestilens.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_4_1_description	The world as it is cannot be allowed to continue. So is the decree of the Great Horned Rat, handed down to Clan Pestilens. The 'clean' world must be pushed aside, swept away by a deluge of disease.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_5_1_description	What can be left when Pestilens is done with the world? Nothing, truly, can be allowed to survive. Everything must be consumed by buboes; given over completely to the cankerous, tumescent diseases unleashed in the name of the Great Horned Rat.	true
mission_text_text_mis_outcome_fail	Mission Failed!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_1_3_description	The pestilential zealotry of a Plague Priest is above that of even the Plague Monks. They are charged with spreading disease the world over, converting even their own bodies into altars of foul infection, as an example for the lesser Monks to follow.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_2_3_description	Clan Pestilens arose from the feverish, infected swamps of Lustria. There, the afflicted and delirious ratmen were visited by an epiphany; the Great Horned Rat demanded that they spread pestilence the world over, in exchange for their measly lives. Desperate and febrile, they accepted.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_3_3_description	The Plague Monks answer to the Plague Priests, who themselves answer only to the Plaguelords of Clan Pestilens themselves. The greatest and boldest of the Monks are recognised for their filth, and promised commendation by the Great Horned Rat himself, when their mission is finally accomplished.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_4_3_description	Plague Priests wield fierce and disgusting magical power, which they claim is granted to them by the Great Horned Rat himself. True or not, it is clear they are supremely powerful - their noxious abilities can reduce an opponent to a quivering mess of disease almost instantly.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_5_3_description	Where other Skaven clans go to war with unmatched fury and terrifying hunger, to combat Clan Pestilens is to know a deeper kind of fear; every man fears death, but to die in writhing agony as disease wracks and mutates your body? There is no worse fate.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_1_2_description	The Plague Monks serve only one God: death. Above all else, they desire to spread foul disease and terminal infection across the world. Even to the Skaven, they are abominable to look upon, soiled and dishevelled rags covering them as they chant from the Book of Woe.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_2_2_description	The Skaven are ingenious engineers, able to use their bizarre minds to concoct and unusual weapons of war that wreak havoc, both for their enemies and Skaven alike. Clan Pestilens, of course, always finds a way to adapt these devices to their foul purposes.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_3_2_description	The Great Horned Rat demanded of the Clan Pestilens leaders of old that they dedicate themselves, unwaveringly, to the spread of disease. Every moment they exist, the Plague Monks are tirelessly concocting new infections, to better corrupt the world.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_4_2_description	To face an army of Clan Pestilens is an endurance test for the senses, as much as of the body. Not only do the rats bring sores upon their very bodies, but they hurl their foul disease into enemy ranks from the backs of engineer-wrought catapults.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_lord_skrolk_5_2_description	When a Plague Monk is particularly devoted - or, perhaps driven insane by disease - they are bestowed the Plague Censer. Placed inside is a chunk of Warpstone and a ladle of disease. The Censer Bearer is then sent amongst the enemy ranks, where foul pestilence affects all.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_lokhir_5_description	Only a fool would dare challenge Lokhir Fellheart! With his power and notoriety now ensuring his family’s name is sufficiently feared, Lokhir can concentrate on plundering and slaughtering to glut the bloodthirst of his red blades. Those who thought themselves safe from his reach should think again, for the Krakenlord has returned, his attentions undivided, and he is as ferocious and cruel as ever!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_lokhir_4_description	Few powerful Druchii can avoid being a target for assassination or deposition at some point in their lives, but Lokhir is one of the few due to his brutal handling of mutineers and plotters in the past. His return home had been hailed as soon as he’d left Karond Kar, and most miscreants who sought to take advantage of his departure quickly thought twice before making a move against his family. Lokhir’s continued expansion overseas shall serve to reinforce that!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_lokhir_3_description	With ample spoils secured and countless natives put to the sword, Lokhir is almost ready to make the journey home. His Black Ark fleet awaits his command to set sail, but further lands still await annexation. Karond Kar must be made to quake with the news of his exploits – the nobles will soon be reminded that as long as Lokhir lives, none are to interfere with his family, lest they forfeit their necks to his red blades!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_lokhir_2_description	Most inhabitants of the cities despoiled by the Krakenlord in Lustria and beyond have unsurprisingly taken to resisting his demands of subservience. Lokhir's power may be in the ascendancy, but it still remains too risky for him to return to Naggaroth without a sufficiently elevated reputation, which will surely come with taking more swathes of territory abroad.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_lokhir_1_description	Lokhir Fellheart has domineered the seas for so long that he can barely picture his homeland far to the north, the frozen lands of Naggaroth. He must eventually return to Karond Kar before the other noble houses make a move against his family in his absence, but knows that he must first expand his holdings overseas lest he look weak when he arrives.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_1_1_description	The Lizardmen are many, birthed from spawning pools and bred for war. Kroq-Gar will need as many strong Skinks and Saurus at his command, for to destroy the forces of Chaos will be no easy task.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_2_1_description	From the mighty Saurus to the teeming Skinks, to the towering and imposing Bastiladon, all Lizardmen must be employed to the effort of war against the warm bloods. It, after all, demanded of them.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_3_1_description	Only through constant battle, and tireless fury, can Kroq-Gar hope to lead his forces to victory over Chaos. Amongst the ruined temples of Lustria, and from countless spawning pools, he must draw more and more Lizardmen to his cause, to fight under his banner.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_4_1_description	From coast to coast, they must rise up; the Lizardmen. From the spawning pools across Lustria, the call to war drives them ever onward, and the Old One's desires ensures they can never stop.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_5_1_description	The Carnosaur is the apex predator of the Lustrian jungles. Huge, muscular creates, the Carnosaur can move with surprising speed for such a large beast, and is lethal when attacking with its enormous, axe-like maw. Upon their backs, a Lizardman warrior is king of the battlefield.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_1_3_description	Lizardmen history is littered with the mighty exploits of noble individuals that helped staunch the tide of Chaos; true heroes of Lustria. These noble warriors must surely be a part of the Great Plan, born to enact the Old One's will.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_2_3_description	The domestication of the ferocious, but dim-witted, Cold Ones turned the already formidable Saurus warrior into a destructive cavalry force. Not only does the Saurus fight furiously, but their steed, also, cannot resist gnashing and ripping into foes with its claws and teeth.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_3_3_description	The disappearance of the Old Ones taught the Lizardmen one thing - they cannot exist without leaders, without direction. And so leaders must emerge, both wise mage-priest and mighty warriors, to drive the Lizardmen forward, to ever greater glory.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_4_3_description	The Great Plan is not something that all Lizardmen innately know. It is handed down from the Slann to their Skink Priests, and then to the rest. Lizardmen rely on great leaders and prophets to guide their actions.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_5_3_description	There are no others like Kroq-Gar, there is only Kroq-Gar. As long as he can remember, the Saurus knows only war. In his mind's eye, he still sees Xhotl, his home, and to him his battle to defend it never ends.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_1_2_description	Kroq-Gar is well-versed in war. As the last defender of the doomed city of Xhotl in the Great Catastrophe, he has seen the face of Chaos up close, and emerged victorious. There is no better choice to continue leading the assault against Ruin.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_2_2_description	Kroq-Gar knows only war, knows only battle. Since escaping the collapse of Xhotl, he stalked the jungles of Lustria, bringing destruction to all his enemies, until Mazdamundi summoned him, to give his rage a focus; it is this purpose that drives him now.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_3_2_description	Kroq-Gar is a warrior beyond any of his cold-blooded ilk. When he rides to war ,the enemy should know they are about to face greatness, and likely destruction. With the gifts of Mazdamundi at his disposal, his fury and power cannot be matched.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_4_2_description	War is in the Lizardmen's blood. From the tenacious anger of the Skinks, to the charging fury of the Troglodons, they are evolved for war. And so war they shall have, in the name of Lustria.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_5_2_description	The Lizardmen are not deliberately malicious creatures, like the Skaven or their northern enemies, the Dark Elves. However, they care not for the machinations of others, only the realisation of their Great Plan. Anyone foolish enough to interfere faces the full fury of the Lustrians.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_1_5_description	It is believed, through the wisdom of Mazdamundi, that the Old One's plan cannot be enacted until certain conditions are met. And so the learned mage-priest sets forth decrees and objectives, that he determines are vital to anticipate the Old One's desires.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_2_5_description	It is only the Slann Mage-Priests who truly understand the complexities of the Great Plan. They are not to be distrusted, and so their demands must be met, for they speak with the voice of the gods.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_3_5_description	Kroq-Gar sets forth on his mandated mission with a steely determination, befitting of his role as assigned by Mazdamundi. To be sure, for his journey to be successful, he must do much and more that is demanded of him from his Slann overlord.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_4_5_description	It is not for Kroq-Qar to defy the will of Mazdamundi, nor his place to question the Old Ones' intentions. It is for him to relentlessly chase that which he is set after, and claim victory for the Lizardmen by any means necessary.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_5_5_description	The Great Plan is all-consuming, even to one who does not know its intricacies. Kroq-Gar knows that his place in the plan is foreseen, for Mazdamundi has requested specifically him. When the Old Ones return, Kroq-Qar knows he will have done as they desired.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_1_4_description	Kroq-Gar is a Saurus, the mightiest of his already prestigious brood. The Saurus are the solid core of any Lizardman force, born to wage war and protect Lustria. They emerge from spawning pools fully-formed and ready for the battlefield.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_2_4_description	Though the Slann Mage-Priests are wise, they prove difficult to understand. The Slann speak telepathically, and are often locked in meditative trances. Only the Skink Priests, through great effort, are able to commune with their masters and divine their will.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_3_4_description	Unlike some other Lizardmen, a Saurus is not a witless creature; they are extremely sharp creatures, focused relentlessly on the pursuit of war. They are born knowing how to fight, and itching to get to the battlefield to prove their skill.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_4_4_description	The great beasts of Lustria are greater than any Skink or Saurus. Mighty Carnosaurs, ponderous Bastiladons, and towering Stegadons process through the jungle canopy, and can be brought to bear by any Saurus bold enough to tame them.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_kroq_gar_5_4_description	Even the Lizardmen fear the unbridled fury of the jungle beasts, for their ire is indiscriminate. Lustria, more than any Saurus, belongs to the beasts. Yet when harnessed and domesticated, their primordial fury can be directed at Lizardmen enemies with resounding success.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_main_tretch_3_description	It goes well for Tretch - yet again the Craventail has proven himself resilient and able to almost preternaturally dodge trouble, much to the annoyance of his foes. Yet… the labour is not yet complete. The rise of Clan Rictus must continue.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_main_tretch_2_description	A tail-hold in this region is not enough. No-no. The Clan must spread, must infest the underground and riddle it with our spawn. We shall take this realm's wealth and use it for our ends - that is the Clan Rictus way.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_main_tretch_1_description	Warlord Doomclaw makes many demands of Tretch. The first is to gain a substantial tail-hold in this ice-ravaged land. Gnaw deep into this realm's roots so it may one day rival Crookback Mountain as a lair for Clan Rictus.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_main_tretch_5_description	The plan is all but complete; Clan Rictus has grown like a canker, establishing a noisome empire to rival any nest-lair in the Under-Empire, yes-yes! A few more tasks will ensure Tretch can rival the Council - Lord Doomclaw himself will surely be proud-incensed!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_main_tretch_4_description	Rictus is well established in its new land. Craventail's burgeoning proto-empire continues to grow, gnawing just under the surface.

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_2_4_description	As a peacemaker and a being of great power - no lie can escape the lips of any in her presence - the Everqueen is a consummate negotiator. Crafting alliances is key to her strategy for defeating Chaos.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_4_4_description	Tyrion may have a stronger sword arm, Teclis may have more arcane mastery, but none can inspire the Asur and their allies like the Everqueen. She is Isha's champion and guardian of their spirits. Who would turn down her request for aid?	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_5_4_description	Now is the time to bring Ulthuan under the sway of both courts. The Phoenix Throne and the Everqueen's vale shall be united, and Ulthuan will be one.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_1_5_description	The Phoenix King does not order his queen. He can, however, send missives and requests from his throne at Lothern; Alarielle then considers everything carefully before deciding if she should act.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_2_5_description	The Star of Avelorn dims. The Everqueen must undertake a great quest to see it shine again, or all of Avelorn may fall under a pall of dread!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_4_5_description	The Sword of Khaine calls to the worthy, but it would be extreme folly for any to take it... even if their intentions were honourable. It is best to occupy the shrine, depriving both friend and enemy of the temptation to wield the God of Murder's own blade.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_5_5_description	Ulthuan must be made pure and kept free of all corruption if the Vortex is to be sustained and the world saved from destruction. To this end, the light of Isha, borne by Avelorn's star, shall radiate across the world.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_1_1_description	Alarielle is a deft warrior, despite her role and title, yet she knows that victory cannot be achieved by bow or sword alone. The Asur must look deeper into their selves and wield another weapon, ingenuity.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_2_1_description	Enlightenment is required if the Asur are to not merely endure, but flourish in this cruel world. Alarielle always encourages her followers to seek lost truths, for it is knowledge, not might, that will win the day.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_3_1_description	Alarielle speaks with the trees and spirits of the ancient woodlands. They know things that even the wisest loremaster of Saphery will never learn from their dusty scrolls.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_4_1_description	Through use of the Worldroots, Alarielle has often travelled beyond Ulthuan's border incognito; her desire to learn of friends - and enemies - has always been strong. For with understanding comes the power to bridge alliances or the downfall of foes.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_5_1_description	To know about this world is a blessing and a curse. For many mortals it is better to writhe in ignorance and so be spared the terrible truth that the world is doomed and all we can do is but delay it. The Everqueen knows this, but does she believe it?	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_1_2_description	An invocation of the daughter of Isha is made to prove that the Everqueen holds no envy in her soul. Lileath herself loves Alarielle like a sister, so one may summon the blessing of the other.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_1_3_description	With her year-long ceremonial marriage to King Finubar long over, the Everqueen is free to raise any other prince, hero or heroine up as she desires. Her favoured champion will attend her needs and become an envoy to Avelorn.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_2_3_description	There is magic in life and vice versa. An accomplished enchantress herself, Alarielle knows only too well the power of the arcane. As such, she welcomes any capable Mage to her court.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_3_3_description	While enemies quiver in Alarielle's presence, to her friends and allies the Everqueen is a welcome sight. Her envoys will set their camps where needed in the hope of bringing unity to all the forces of Order.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_4_3_description	Those who please Alarielle - those with good hearts, who are heroes in the truest sense of the word - are worthy of elevation, so that they may continue to serve the Everqueen's court.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alarielle_5_3_description	As the final wars loom, High Magic - the true power of the Elves - is needed to defeat lingering enemies. The Everqueen knows this, so welcomes Mages to her court.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_1_5_description	As time makes a chasm between the Old Ones and the Slann, the Great Plan of their forebears becomes obfuscated and blurry. Yet Mazdamundi knows that evil dwells in all places, and Chaos lurks, ever-ready, so the Lizardmen must seek it out and destroy it, wherever it emerges.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_2_5_description	The Lizardmen are constantly beset by those who would see them and their ways undone. So many temples lie in ruins, as the forces of Chaos - or man, or some other destructive ilk - have been allowed to run rampant. War can only be answered with war.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_3_5_description	The fracturing of Lustria in the Great Catastrophe left the Lizardmen disparate, with many tribes feeling bereft and alone. Unification and reconquest of lost Lustrian lands is chief amongst the Slann's designs, as part of fulfilling the Old One's Great Plan.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_4_5_description	There is no plan but the Great Plan. No way but the Lizardman way. No path but the one that Mazdamundi has set upon. Lustria must unify, Mazdamundi must reign, the Plan must succeed!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_5_5_description	From Hexoatl in Isthmus, to Xlanzec in the south, all of Lustria belongs to the Lizardmen. Or, at least, it should. No force can be permitted to halt Mazdamundi's advance. The Lizardmen will unify, or die!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_durthu_1_main_heading	From Small Seeds…	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_1_4_description	At the apex of the towering Lizardmen pyramids, the star chambers allow the Slann to see view the span of the cosmos. Through celestial observation, the mage priests see what was, what is, and what might be.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_2_4_description	As the Old Ones emerged from the heavens, so too did they return there. From the star chambers, the sweeping arc of the cosmos reveals itself to the Slann, that they might observe and, with the grace of transcendental wisdom, understand.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_3_4_description	To the unobservant, the stars in the sky seems unconnected and disparate; simply floating gems in the tapestry of night. The Slann know otherwise. The stars weave a pattern of history and prophecy; through these observations, they will gain clarity and purpose.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_4_4_description	The Slann desire above all to receive some word from the Old Ones again; to know they are not totally abandoned. They have raised great structures of communication and contemplation across Lustria to this end; The Ziggurat of Dawn, the Sentinels of Xeti and, of course, myriad star chambers.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_5_4_description	As Mazdamundi stares at the patchwork blanket of the cosmos, he must wonder if the Old Ones are still out there; if there is purpose to the Great Plan. He remembers them, so he cannot lose hope. They will return, and the Lizardmen will be ready.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_1_1_description	The Slann Mage-Priests are custodians of the Lizardmen: a duty charged to them by the Old Ones, many millennia ago. It falls to the Slann, then, and Mazdamundi as chief amongst them, to see the Lizardmen unified under the Old One's vision; his vision.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_2_1_description	Chaos are the eternal enemies of all, but no more so than the Lizardmen. Mazdamundi knows their threatening evil more than most, and knows only Lizardmen unity in the face of this onslaught can hope to overcome the torrent of maleficence.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_3_1_description	Lustria was once ascendant - a jungle paradise where all Lizardmen worked harmoniously together for a common purpose, under the watchful eye of the Old Ones. This can be so again; but the Lizardmen must come together now beneath the curious minds of the Slann.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_4_1_description	United, the Lizardmen are a force beyond defeat; a singular vision striking forth with military master; a scourge to all their enemies. Divided, however, they are no more than scurrying amphibians. They must find their unified grit once again.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_5_1_description	Lizardmen fighting Lizardmen is an ugly thing for the Slann to watch, but it is a symptom of the shattering effects of the Great Catastrophe. Pride is a powerful weapon, and it is one Mazdamundi must harness if he is to bring the Lizardmen together.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_1_3_description	Lizardmen history is littered with the mighty exploits of noble individuals that helped staunch the tide of Chaos; true heroes of Lustria. These noble warriors must surely be a part of the Great Plan, born to enact the Old One's will.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_2_3_description	Though the Slann Mage-Priests are wise, they prove difficult to understand. The Slann speak telepathically, and are often locked in meditative trances. Only the Skink Priests, through great effort, are able to commune with their masters and divine their will.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_3_3_description	The disappearance of the Old Ones taught the Lizardmen one thing - they cannot exist without leaders, without direction. And so leaders must emerge, both wise mage-priest and mighty warriors, to drive the Lizardmen forward, to ever greater glory.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_4_3_description	The Great Plan is not something that all Lizardmen innately know. It is handed down from the Slann to their Skink Priests, and then to the rest. Lizardmen rely on great leaders and prophets to guide their actions.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_5_3_description	The power of Mazdamundi is said to be beyond any mortal understanding. He can rip apart mountain ranges and detonate volcanoes if his power is left unchecked. Truly he, above all other mage-priests, is fit to lead the Lizardmen to war.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_1_2_description	Since the Old Ones departed, and the calamitous coming of Chaos, the Lizardmen have ever waged war. Both as defenders and as invaders, the Lizardmen have prosecuted the Old One's desires, protecting Lustria - and indeed the world - as decreed by Mazdamundi.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_2_2_description	Lustria is beset by foolish man and filthy Skaven, all of who encroach upon the hallowed and sacred lands of the Lizardmen. They bring with them corruption and deception. There is no place for them amongst the jungles. They must all be purged.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_3_2_description	The Lizardmen are powerful combatants, and the magical might of the Slann is beyond comprehension. Whilst Skinks and Saurus warriors dive headlong into the fray, the Mage-Priests summon spells that can rend the very mountains asunder, assaulting their foes with the very fury of the Old Ones.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_4_2_description	Battle is in the Lizardmen's blood. From the tenacious anger of the Skinks, to the charging fury of the Troglodons, they are evolved for war. And so war they shall have, in the name of Lustria.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_mazdamundi_5_2_description	The Lizardmen are not deliberately malicious creatures, like the Skaven or their northern enemies, the Dark Elves. However, they care not for the machinations of others, only the realisation of their Great Plan. Anyone foolish enough to interfere faces the full fury of the Lustrians.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_kemmler_2_description	A promising start… darkness grows and the dead walk across the mountain chain.

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_1_5_description	Malekith is a powerful testament of his own failure. The most powerful Dark Elven Lord in existence, he was nevertheless spurned by the Asur in ages past, and eternally seeks vengeance for this unforgivable slight.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_2_5_description	Malekith has, so many times before, attempted to take his revenge on Ulthuan. Yet every time he has been rebuked, sent back scarred, but alive. Thus he endeavours to become ever stronger, ever better, so that he can finally succeed and crush the Asur forever.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_3_5_description	Malekith is scarred by his attempt to claim the throne of Ulthuan. Though he is wracked by physical deformity, the flames also twisted his soul, forging within him an all-consuming desire for apocalyptic revenge on the Asur.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_4_5_description	Malekith once tried to destroy the world, and he will do so again. He sees nobody but himself fit to rule over the land and, having been spurned by the one throne he desires, is now fixated on tearing it apart - the ultimate act of revenge.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_5_5_description	Malekith will be ascendant in this life or the next. That the Phoenix Crown is beyond his reach now is known, yet there are other thrones upon which he may yet sit. A throne of cinders, as the world burns, seems most appealing to him.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_1_4_description	To be imprisoned by the armies of the Witch King is a fate nobody would wish on his worst enemy. Thralls of the Druchii are subjected to back-breaking labour and torture. It is a blessed mercy to be killed early, and swiftly.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_2_4_description	Every slave taken by Malekith strengthens his fight against the High Elves. Each and every man taken provides strength to the Druchii, through manual labour or simply the sport of having them killed.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_3_4_description	The Dark Elves are merciless creatures but there is certainly a practical use in not killing every survivor of battle. Whilst scores of them will be executed, of course, others will be put to work. The labour will eventually kill them, naturally.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_4_4_description	The chattel of war process from the battlefield to serve the Dark Elves dark desires. All of them are marked for death, the only variable is the manner of their demise, and how long their bodies will endure before giving in to sweet release.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_5_4_description	Strength over others is the mantra of the Dark Elves, and what better way to demonstrate absolute power over another than by enslaving them? The defeated survivors of battle are made to work for their new Druchii overlords, until the punishing pace finally kills them.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_1_3_description	Malekith does not care to conquer the world, only to see it burn. So slighted does he feel that he would rather see the world destroyed than control it. If he has to preside over a dominion of ashes, then so be it.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_2_3_description	Naggaroth and, in the south, Lustria are littered with the settlements of lesser creatures. Barbarians, Lizardmen, Vampires… all of them testaments to weakness. All of them must die, their cities burned and their hopes extinguished.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_3_3_description	Black Ark towers dot the landscape of Naggaroth like gnarled fingers reaching skywards. The Black Arks are the Dark Elves homes; everything beyond the horizon - to the Druchii - is fit to burn.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_4_3_description	The Druchii do not contemplate peace; there can only be war without end. Whenever the Dark Elves are not at war, they are contemplating their next conflict. The desire to destroy is absolute; it courses through the Druchii's veins.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_5_3_description	The world must come tumbling down, and no Druchii ever saw peace as a viable means to do so. Destruction is not so much a conscious choice of the Dark Elves as it is a primordial desire.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_1_2_description	Malekith is bred for battle, renowned as one of the greatest Elven warriors alive. His thirst for battle is quenched in gruesome combat, where he tears enemies apart in a melancholic rage.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_2_2_description	Though the Asur must fall to Druchii might, there are yet others the Dark Elves cut their teeth on. The multitudinous barbarians that wander the frozen expanses provide excellent practice, whilst further south in Lustria, there are more thralls to be found.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_3_2_description	There are few in the world who can claim to be as powerful as Malekith, the Witch King. When he rides to battle, he does so sure in the knowledge that whosoever he is about to face is soon to be utterly crushed before his might.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_4_2_description	The abject cruelty in every Dark Elven soldier is without question. Strength is the only determining faction to the Druchii - the strong survive and flourish, whilst the weak are destroyed.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_5_2_description	Druchii deal in death; it is their strongest and most dependable currency. Each battlefield is a masterpiece of massacre; bodies fall by the droves before the unflinchingly savage attacks of the Merciless Host.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_1_1_description	Malekith is a lord of war, but for all his power, war is won by armies. If he is to ever march back upon his ancestral home and tear it apart, he will need strong warriors at his side.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_2_1_description	The Merciless Host answer only to the Witch King, and ride to war under his banner. Their creed is that the strong can do as they please, for the weak are too pathetic to stop them. Glory to the mighty!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_3_1_description	The Druchii armies are terrifying forces of destruction, bent single-mindedly on conquering all before them. Each army is led by a powerful lord, a Dreadlord of Naggaroth, who drives them forward to claim their prizes in fire.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_4_1_description	A Druchii army is a spectacle of varied horror. Magic crackles from the sceptres of Sorceresses and Dreadlords, whilst Assassins dart in and out of perception. And above them all, Hydras and Dragons breath death into enemy ranks.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_malekith_5_1_description	The War Hydra is one of the largest beasts in all of Naggaroth. Each of its many heads is cantankerous and violent, and powerful is the army who tames one of these beasts. The beasts are so furious and unpredictable, that many Druchii armies choose instead to avoid them altogether.	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_dwarf_3_main_heading	One Dwarfhold At a Time 	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_harkon_4_description	His mind may not be fully healed yet, but his psyche has become slightly more controllable, his strength at levels never achieved before, and his ambition only growing with every victory. Once Harkon was naive, looting powerful relics and treasures, playing lord of a small land, but no more. He has seen his true potential, petty baubles and faux empires interest him no more – only complete dominance of the world will do.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_harkon_5_description	The civilisations of Lustria have fallen and those who still draw breath there know their demise is imminent – desperate last stands are all that remain for them now. Harkon has conquered this land intending to create an empire worthy of his power; an empire with borders not limited to the New World. The rest of the world must now contend with the Lord of Lustria, monstrous monarch of the Vampire Coast, the Arch Grand Commodore of death itself!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_harkon_1_description	Luthor Harkon has been battling with himself for some time, his fractured mind recently causing him to lose grip on his Undead pirate empire. Mutineers have emerged, insolently stealing part of his land named for his exploits. The fog of his mind lifts just enough for Luthor to unite his wills – it is time for the Pirate King to raid the hovels of any nearby landlubbers, murdering all before him on his way to regaining supremacy.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_harkon_2_description	Harkon has re-established some control over both his mind and his lands; now, the time has come to use this momentum to try and repair his psyche once and for all. His pirate kingdom has made great strides, but there will be no lull in the killing. Now is the time to lash out across his borders, especially at the Lizardmen of the New World who gave him this cursed affliction of the mind.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_harkon_3_description	The Vampire Coast grows, and so does the horde of Undead sailors who fell victim to its perilous shores. Yet Luthor’s personalities still bicker over his goals, with some wanting to restore his mind and destroy the Slann responsible for breaking it, while others simply lusting after territory and plunder. Luthor can only try and steer himself towards the Lizardmen, but beyond the Vampire Coast there are plenty of other targets out there.	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_vampire_3_main_description	Now is the time for Fell Bats to blot out the sun, for gloom to fall upon the lands of the living and the Long Night to begin. Mannfred's dominion shall extend far and wide if the prophecies in the Liber Noctus are to come true. 	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_1_5_description	When the Phoenix King speaks, the High Elves listen. Anar is technically sworn to carry out the whims of his arch-liege, and see the needs of the High Elves met. To this end, he occasionally scours the land in the name of the Phoenix King.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_2_5_description	An empty quiver is of no use to warrior or hunter, and Alith Anar is both. It is time to embark on a great quest and bring the Shadow King's legendary bow into play!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_4_5_description	There's a reason the Druchii never trust the shadows, for they never truly know what lurks within. Sometimes a shadow is just a shadow, but on other occasions it is assassins from their own bastard families… Yet, although it is a rare event, sometimes it is a warrior of Nagarythe that awaits them!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_5_5_description	Ulthuan must be made pure, must be kept free of all corruption, if the Vortex is to be sustained and the world saved from destruction. To this end, every enemy should be gutted; their corpses dissected and splayed open for all to see. That is the Nagarythe way - that is the way of the Shadow King.	true
mission_text_text_mis_activity_own_a_region_in_n_provinces_1_of_1	Hold at least one settlement in the following province: 	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_1_4_description	Tor Anlec lies off the Sundered coast. In its day it was a great tower that stood prominently against the raging sea. It was - and should remain - part of the Shadow King's realm. Ensure it remains so.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_2_4_description	Serving as the Witch King’s chief shipyard, Clar Karond is a worthy prize. Should Anar bring shadow to the Tower of Doom, then the naval power of the Druchii will surely be weakened.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_3_4_description	The dread city of Har Ganeth, home of the Crone - the whore of Khaine - Hellebron! Bringing this city under the rule of the Shadow King will send a strong message to the Druchii that nowhere is safe from Alith Anar!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_4_4_description	Rumour has it that Morathi has moved from Ghrond to Quintex. Maybe her students in the Dark Convent realised they are being taught by a serpent? It matters not; the Shadow King should hunt her down and take from the Hag whatever she claims.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_5_4_description	To take the city of his nemesis would finally sate the Shadow King's vengeance… perhaps. It would, at the very least, scratch a satisfying itch and cause Loec to dance across the heavens. And Malekith - should he still live - would surely rage!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_1_3_description	Anar does not concern himself with the petty politics of the Elven princes. He is focused only upon his mission to rid the lands of the Druchii. For that, he must retain a certain mystique and majesty.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_3_3_description	The power of the Shadow King is as legendary as his wrath. Alith must ensure his being and majesty matches his reputation, or risk disappointing his followers… and his foes.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_5_3_description	Even more feared than Tyrion or his brother, when the Shadow King stalks abroad it's not just the Druchii who should fear him - beardlings and mannish folk alike will all taste the power of Anar, should they get in the Raven Lord's way.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_1_2_description	When Alith Anar strikes, he leaves naught but corpses of his victims and a palpable sense of fear. An enemy that fears you is one that can be tamed and dominated. Strike now, and spread fear.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_2_2_description	The reason the Shadow King is so feared by his former kin is because he and his dread followers will strike from the shadows without mercy or the faintest shred of pity. It is time to enact vengeance and spread this fear to others!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_1_1_description	Bring the shadows to the fore. It is time for Nagarythe and its allies to gather. The southern kingdoms of Ulthuan have had their chance but squandered it, as they always do. The Shadow King's legions await his command.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc10_objective_BONUS_alith_anar_2_1_description	A host of Nagarythe is something that would make even the hated Witch King quake in his armour. To gather the desperate bands of Shadow Warriors and their wayward allies is no easy task, but should Alith summon them, they will come.	true
mission_text_text_mis_activity_sign_non_aggression_pact_any	Sign a [[img:icon_non-aggression_pact]][[/img]]non-aggression pact with any faction.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_main_teclis_1_description	This world was once the dominion of the High Elves; now they are brought to lesser significance in the twilight of their race. Yet their fury and pride have not diminished - from Ulthuan, the High Elves continue to strike out at their enemies, in defence of the world.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_main_teclis_2_description	After the Sundering, too much was allowed to fall into Druchii hands, and so much else besides slipped into the oceans. What cannot be saved must be destroyed; the enemies of Ulthuan must be hounded to the ends of the world.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_main_teclis_3_description	There are enemies of the Asur everywhere, and enemies of the Asur are enemies of the world itself. To the west, the Dark Elves plot the destruction of all life, so corrupted have they become. They, and their ilk, cannot be suffered to survive!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_main_teclis_4_description	If Ulthuan is to be free to know peace, or to regain a semblance of its former glory, all enemies must be expelled from the land, then pursued to their source and destroyed.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_main_teclis_5_description	At the heart of Ulthuan lies the Vortex, a dimensional rift that, through the actions of the High Elves, holds the world together. If the Vortex falls - as some would see it do - then the world will be ripped apart. All enemies of the Vortex must therefore be vanquished!	true

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_greenskins_4_3_description	Grimgor has no mates, he just tolerates a select few and even those run the risk of been cleaved in twain by Gitsnik should they anger him.

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_greenskins_3_2_description	While spells of da Little Waaagh! are already at the Greenskins' disposal, it's time to get some of the 'bigga spellz' in play. Maybe a foot or fist of Gork to really wind the enemy up? Go and find an Orc Shaman.	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_greenskins_4_2_description	The true horror of the Greenskin menace is not always seen on the battlefield but in the devastation left in the wake of the Orc ravagers.

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_greenskins_1_5_description	The boyz need loot. The boss needs loot. Grimgor needs loot. Every git needs loot! So they better find it; a good few raids should sort out the cash flow.	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_greenskins_2_5_description	Orcs will travel leagues to join a burgeoning Waaagh!, but they won't come for just any Warboss. They are attracted to those favoured by the Gods, by those whose legends are created by the quests they undertake. 	true

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_greenskins_4_5_description	The best and shiniest stuff… the loot that can make the eyes of the hardiest Warboss water, is rarely in the neighbouring location. The boyz are going to have to loot deep into enemy territory to get the good stuff!   	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_greenskins_5_5_description	Even for Orcs, the lure of shiny stuff is as strong as the thrill of murder - the richest bosses are always the most successful. If Grimgor is to bring about Ragnarork then he must become the wealthiest Greenskin as well. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_skarsnik_2_main_description	If the Greenskins are going to fear Skarsnik - and they should - then he must use his influence and build up a great green horde to launch an invasion and crush all his enemies. The local tribes must fall into line or get a proper bootin'!	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_greenskins_1_4_description	Nothing pleases an Orc than being part of a big green mob, mindlessly charging into the enemy.

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_greenskins_2_4_description	The Boss is eager to mercilessly crush his foes, but there's a few things that need doing in preparation for the big charge. Get these done, and keep Grimgor happy. 	true

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_greenskins_4_4_description	Although Ironhide will never admit it, he belligerently knows that he needs the Bosses and Shamans around him to enact his will away from the mobs. Empower them so they may serve Gork (or Mork!). 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_greenskins_5_4_description	Grimgor's most feared allies need not only his backing so they can go about unimpeded, but if they are to spread the word of Ironhide's Waaagh! then they must be granted the power such a message demands! 	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_1_3_description	Rumours reach Arkhan that relics of Nagash have been discovered in Al Haikk. Arkhan should take this realm and purge it if he must, for his master might be close.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_2_3_description	Uncover the past and the future will be secured - a wise mantra of the Liche Priests, so the Liche King should set them to researching the lost dynasties of old.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_3_3_description	The Black Tower of Arkhan belongs to no one but the Liche King himself. It is time for him to return.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_4_3_description	Even the statuary of Nehekhara fear the Liche King and bend to his cruel will. Even the Necrosphinx shall surrender to Arkhan.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_2_2_description	The rituals and incantations of the Liche King require base minerals such as salt and lime. Arkhan must send minions forth to locate these resources.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_3_2_description	Control of the world is not only about causing death. Dominance of resources, both natural and crafted, is another form of leverage.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_4_2_description	To the long-dead, the resources that the living crave are mere trinkets. But depriving the enemy - living or corpse - of them, does indeed give these resources value.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_5_2_description	All the world's treasures and relics should be reaped by the Liche King, but not for any mundane accumulation of wealth. A few rare specimens may hide a faction of his master's dark spirit.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_1_1_description	Once a lieutenant to the Arch-Necromancer, but now a king in his own right. He is the Liche King, and one as mighty as he is worthy of a greater rank.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_2_1_description	The Liche King is one of the most powerful creatures that walks this world. And so he must exude such power by attaining the twelfth rank.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_3_1_description	Arkhan is feared throughout the lands - even Tomb Kings will think twice before engaging him in battle. But fear is transient - Arkhan must maintain his power, and increase his rank to ensure compliance.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_4_1_description	A great burden, it will cost much for Arkhan to enact his scheme and put events into motion that may bring back his master. He must be prepared and at the apex of his power.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_5_1_description	To rule the world in his master's stead, the Liche King must be worthy of Nagash himself. Arkhan must attain rank 30.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_1_5_description	Arkhan has never totally trusted the advisors sent by the Mortuary Cult, suspecting they serve their own agenda. Let them prove their worth!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_2_5_description	It is right that the Liche Priests serve the Liche King. Arkhan shall have them tame the relics of old and craft new tools for the travails to come.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_4_5_description	Over millennia, many great legions have been lost in the sands. Let the Liche Priests chant, and hopefully they will find what was once lost… or at the very least fashion some relic to help this cause.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_5_5_description	The Liche Priests offer obsequious bows to their Liche King. All he asks to prove their loyalty is a tool of ultimate power he can use against Nagash's enemies.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_1_4_description	Arkhan has always been more than a mere Liche - in his mortal days he was a general and soldier first, and never lost a battle…	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_2_4_description	Like his master, much of Arkhan's power resides in the relics and items imbued with power. Needs must that he leave his capital and in search of such a relic.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_3_4_description	Hidden in the scrolls, deep in the meanings of the hieroglyphics, will be clues to ancient dynasties. Seek them out and Arkhan will have access to allies from the age of antiquity.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_4_4_description	We have no time for family trees, they are consigned to history. No, Arkhan must seek out the lost dynasties using her Liches.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_arkhan_5_4_description	The Land of Nehekhara: greatest of all civilisations and birthplace of both Arkhan and Nagash in the distant past. It must become the Liche King's possession!	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_2_2_description	A sad indictment of the Karaz Ankor is that many a Dwarfhold's Sacred Forge remains unlit, the holy fires burning low or extinguished altogether. It is time they grew bright once more, with a Runesmith hammering at the hearth. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_3_2_description	Nothing fills Dwarfish hearts than seeing brave, bearded warriors with axes in hand, march out to war. A mighty throng is an army that any foe will dread to face! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_4_2_description	The Dwarfs know a righteous cause when they see one, and Belegar's quest to reclaim the Eight Peaks is one they all wish to see succeed. The High King has opened his coffers to the Ironhammer, and so too do all Dwarfs, that his throne might be reclaimed for the Karaz Ankor!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_5_2_description	As final victory, for good or ill, draws near, Belegar Ironhammer's influence should be as unyielding as Dwarfen steel. Control of powerful Institutions and Guilds, as well as his own Clan, will give the Ironhammer an edge that will keep all grumblers in line.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_1_3_description	During the Golden Age, many wonders of the Old World were Dwarf-built and hidden under the mountains. Let the Dwarfs bring about such an age again.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_2_3_description	There is no definitive rule that marks out the Greatholds from the Dwarfholds. It could be argued that it's the Clansfolk that inhabit the Holds, or the great monuments and halls. Whatever the definition, more Greatholds can only make the Karaz Ankor grow in power. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_3_3_description	Karaz-a-Karak is the greatest Hold and capital of the Karaz Ankor and seat of the High King since the time before time. Could another Dwarfhold one day rival Everpeak itself? Doubtful. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_4_3_description	The Royal Dwarf Clans, including Clan Angrund, are full of gifted Thanes and Riks, ready to take control of the many Dwarf throngs for war. Such Lords must be empowered so they are ready to lead, even as the urks approach their doors.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_5_3_description	The final battle is upon the Dwarfs - the great war of vengeance that will see all other races bow before their might. Yet Belegar Ironhammer cannot do all things alone - he must ensure his closest allies, and those Dwarfs who have supported him thus far, are at their most powerful.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_1_1_description	Any Dwarfhold worth its foundations must be able to fill its vaults with gold. Debt is for the beardless! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_2_1_description	With the High King's tacit permission, the innovators faction within the Engineers' Guild are starting to actually invent things! The traditionalists are in uproar, but the Age of Reckoning will be won in part with new methods, not stagnation! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_3_1_description	Even the traditionalists of the Engineers' Guild have been won over by this new outlook of improving and iterating on the concepts of the older generations. Continue the engineering renaissance!  	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_4_1_description	In the Golden Age, Dwarf throngs comprising thousands of beards would regularly march between Holds, scattering Beastmen and Greenskins alike. While such a sight is much rarer these days, it is surely one to make even the most obstinate Rik proud. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_5_1_description	Not since the War of the Beard… since when the Ancestor gods walked among the mountain folk… has an army as grand marched forth. The Age of Reckoning is now, the Dammaz Kron wiped clean! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_1_4_description	The Dwarfs do not forgive or forget very easily, but it is time to strike some grudges from the Dammaz Kron, if only to make room for more. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_2_4_description	Each grudge against the Dwarfs is a link in a chain that weighs the whole of the Karaz Ankor low. Thorgrim and his kin must break those chains, and set Dwarfen-folk free!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_3_4_description	So long as the Dammaz Kron remains filled with the wrongs done to them, the Dwarfs can never put down their axes. No Dwarf can rest as long as there are grudges outstanding!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_4_4_description	The Age of Reckoning is upon the Dwarfs, and many heroes will be forged, their sagas to be sung in drinking halls for the rest of time. Such heroes should be found and raised to greatness, for they can only aid the cause.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_5_4_description	It is a time of heroes - an age not seen since Grimnir led great Dwarf warriors into battle. It is time for Belegar Ironhammer to do the same, to bring about such an era, or make his kin believe it so. A great Dwarf Lord should empower such heroes - raise them to greatness!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_orion_1_main_description	At the centre of the realms of Athel Loren lies the Oak of Ages, beating heart of the forest and the sacred shrine of the Asrai. From the mighty Oak, life flows into the forest and through the world.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_1_5_description	Some of the younger generation of Dwarf Engineers are beginning to research and 'innovate'. This doesn't sit well with the traditionalists in the Engineers' Guild, but the High King needs such inquisitive minds in the wars ahead.  	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_2_5_description	Dwarfs put great stock in the telling of tales, be they sung or recounted in verse. Our Lords need to become like warriors of myth by forging their own legends. For in doing so the Dwarf folk will follow them into the End Times and beyond!  	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_3_5_description	To Valaya's sorrow, the Dwarf race is in decline; the older folk outnumber the younger beardlings by some margin. Each Dwarf death is a blow to the entire Dwarfen people; Belegar must ensure he wins battles but convincingly - slaying his foes and keeping his kin alive!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_4_5_description	Despite claims from the Empire and the stubbornness of the traditionalists, Dwarfs are the most technically-able race. A High King who does not furnish its greatest minds and inventors to leverage such gifts is as ignorant as nobles from other races.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_belegar_5_5_description	The Age of Reckoning is now. From his reclaimed throne, Belegar Ironhammer needs every ounce of his strength to aid the restoration of the Karaz Ankor. This includes technologies both ancient and new - sweep the traditions of stagnation away, bring innovation to its zenith!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_1_3_description	An action that could lead to misery, for there is only one king that should reign in a dark tower, and he is not the Liche King - not that bag of bones. No, only the King of Kings can author this action.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_4_3_description	It is time for Settra to add another title to his list, 'Taker of the Black Pyramid', thereby despoiling the legacy of the Usurper.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_5_3_description	It is not just loyal warriors who do the bidding of the Great King, even statues wake at his very command. And none are more deadly than the Necrosphinx!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_1_2_description	The collection of the gold artefacts mean more than an ornamental accumulation of wealth. They hold great power worthy of royalty.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_2_2_description	A kingdom, even an Undead one, needs resources to thrive. Settra must acquire idols and pottery from which the hands of his Unliving craftsmen can carve new legacies.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_3_2_description	The desert gives very little, but what gifts there are hidden in the mountains and dunes belong to Settra.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_4_2_description	It is not merely land and unswervingly loyal thralls that Settra needs for dominance, but the meagre riches these lands hold. The Great King must take what resources he can.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_5_2_description	The accumulation of wealth - of things - has long been quenched for Settra. These are mortal desires, a Tomb King only cares for one thing - power. Nevertheless, if these resources are the milestones to such power, then attain them he must.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_1_1_description	Settra is the greatest of kings; he must quickly attain a rank that befits such a status. 	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_3_1_description	There is none of higher rank than the Khemrikhara. Even so, attaining the eighteenth rank should prove beyond any doubts that enemies may harbour.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_4_1_description	All in Nehekhara - from slave and serf to king - bow to Settra. He must ensure subservience by gaining a high rank.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_5_1_description	At last, Settra shall attain a rank worthy of his legacy, worthy of his titles - do we need to remind anyone of those…?	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_settra_1_5_description	It was Settra that demanded the Mortuary Cult's existence. And now he has need of it. He shall order the Liche Priests to his whim.	true

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_vampire_2_4_description	Mannfred lies at the centre of a great web of intrigue. A manipulator worthy of Tzeentch! From his lair, our master sends word to his puppets of tasks to be done, accounts to be settled and missions to achieve.  	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_vampire_3_4_description	As the Undead rise and march forth, the influence of Dark Magic spreads across the lands - fell creatures take roost in once-homely caves, trees become rotten and twisted, and even houses buckle and decay as the corruption spreads. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_vampire_4_4_description	Mannfred sees his agents as little more than tools, yet some tools are more useful than others. For those lucky few minions, great rewards await - depending on how they serve our master of course. 	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_morghur_4_4_description	The Beastmen hate mankind and anything else that dares to get in their way. Their bitterness is unmatched, their hatred unparalleled. Across the Old World, there are none who hate and war as much as the warherds.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_morghur_5_4_description	Ever watchful, the Bray-Shamans coerce and manipulate the Beastlords, telling them what to do, where to go, how to grow. The Bray-Shamans direct their herds, cultivating them like festering buboes.	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_morghur_2_2_description	Though the herd knows the power and rage of direct assault best of all, there is utility in the machinations of a Bray-Shaman, or the direct, single combat of a towering Gorebull.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_1_1_description	Lokhir is well aware of the disloyal tendencies of Druchii hearts, so fights with savagery as well as skill, using every battle to demonstrate his power to his Corsairs.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_2_1_description	Fellheart is much admired by his Corsairs – not just for his generosity, but also because he fights with savage distinction at the head of every battle.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_3_1_description	The size of a Black Ark has great importance to the Dark Elf Corsair that commands it, and not just for its capacity to carry ever-greater numbers of slaves and warriors; above all, these monstrous ships are a status symbol.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_4_1_description	Slicked with blood when he takes to the battlefield, Lokhir’s red blades always thirst for more; as long as he spills his enemies' blood, they will get what they want.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_5_1_description	Lokhir Fellheart is death incarnate, the ultimate Corsair who fears no-one and should be feared by everyone. Such a talent for killing and leadership has not been seen for generations – this Druchii is both a warrior and leader to be reckoned with.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_1_5_description	By making a sacrifice to the Goddess of the Savage Hunt, Lokhir’s Corsairs can be gifted the joy of the chase, thus serving him more effectively in battle.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_2_5_description	The effect that a monstrous creature can have on a battle cannot be overstated. Whether it’s the fear they evoke or the numbers they slay, they are often an army’s greatest asset for more than just their size alone.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_3_5_description	The more conflict Lokhir can aggressively stoke, the more his new enemies shall bring their troops out in droves to fight him. To the Krakenlord, this simply means more victims to enslave or kill.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_4_5_description	To survive the constant treacheries of Naggaroth, one sometimes has no choice but to join and serve others who are stronger. It may be worth reminding the weaker Dark Elves of that.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_5_5_description	As one war ends another begins, the endless struggle for dominance crosses race and fealty. Ultimately, there is only one victor, with survival being the ultimate reward. Lokhir must continue the slaughter to be the last Druchii standing!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_1_4_description	Forced to torturously work themselves to a slow death if the Krakenlord wills it, those who Lokhir puts into chains can suffer few worse fates. One can only hope for the blessed mercy of a swift end.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_2_4_description	A great Dark Elf commander like Lokhir is always compelled to take on more slaves – for the Druchii, thralls are just as valuable as plundered gold.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_3_4_description	The Krakenlord terrorises all who engage him in combat on the battlefield, but will not kill senselessly – if an enemy is defeated, there can be much to gain from putting survivors to torturous, back-breaking work.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_4_4_description	Defeat to a Dark Elf’s army can only lead to death or enslavement, both of which serve the Dark Elves malicious desires. Indeed, all those defeated are marked for death, it is just a matter of how long their bodies can endure a life of brutal serfdom.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_lokhir_5_4_description	To subjugate the weak and show one’s strength through brutal malice is the way of the Druchii, making them the most ruthless slave masters in the world. The Krakenlord is no different, putting swathes of his downtrodden enemies exactly where they deserve to be – in chains.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_main_mazdamundi_4_description	So much was lost in the Great Catastrophe; Chupayotl collapsed into the sea, whilst the city of gold was taken by the Skaven. Now, what is able to be reclaimed, must be reclaimed, and Mazdamundi will see it done. For the Old Ones are surely watching…	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_main_mazdamundi_5_description	The Old Ones created the Lizardmen as the chosen race, favoured and nurtured by their celestial masters. Others may be permitted, but not at the expense of the Lizardmen. The Slann know this, and must eradicate any that harbour dark desires upon Lustrian ideals.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_main_mazdamundi_2_description	The history of the Lizardmen is written in blood; great volumes of war that have left their mark on land and lizard alike. War is all-consuming for Mazdamundi; only through relentless military undertaking can Chaos be kept at bay, and the Great Plan realised.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_main_mazdamundi_3_description	The onslaught of Chaos, and time, have made ruins of so many of the Lustrian temples. As the jungle attempts to reclaim them, so too do others. This cannot be allowed. If the Lizardmen cannot reclaim their homes, they should be destroyed.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_main_mazdamundi_1_description	Whilst other, lesser creatures think in minutes and hours, Mazdamundi contemplates in centuries. His plans are beyond temporal comprehension, and now, with great deliberation, moves to war. For Mazdamundi sees the wheel of time, and endeavours to turn it himself.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_1_1_description	Luthor’s squabbling personalities sometimes drive him to being the loosest of cannons, but in his more lucid phases he is a most wily commander, with a mind that can take great advantage of wisdom, knowing that it can often lead to greater riches in the future.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_2_1_description	It was Luthor’s endless lust for power and riches that led him into his schizophrenic predicament, and an innate greed for gold still runs through many of his personalities. A raiding campaign would go a long way to silence some of the voices, for now at least.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_3_1_description	Luthor may be on a journey of convalescence – at least most of the time – but his greedy personalities are always appeased by the hoarding of loot.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_4_1_description	Luthor Harkon is renowned for his colossal greed. Whether it be having the most riches, or being the most powerful, it is never enough. Now he has also set his mind on a bigger crew, so that he may command an army worthy of his appetite for raiding!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_5_1_description	Luthor has achieved much since arriving in Lustria, but many more should be brought into the service of the Pirate King to help him achieve his ends. Dredge the sea floor, dig up the graves, kill the locals! The corpses shall be bent to Luthor’s will!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_1_3_description	The Pirate King is unhinged, to say the least, angrily craving to have his murderous spellcasting abilities back. His tumultuous mind gains a little appeasement from taking as few prisoners as possible in battle.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_2_3_description	Harkon’s stirring mind may find it hard to focus, but he at least knows that fighting wars is futile if no ground is gained or progress made. He must push forth and expand the borders of the Vampire Coast!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_3_3_description	The Pirate King’s many personalities cause him to sometimes lose his grip and get distracted in the middle of a fight, so he is always on the lookout for more officers to keep things shipshape when a less competent personality takes over.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_4_3_description	Luthor is always hunting for something, for his mind cannot rest on any one target. Treasure, however, is one of few things that brings consent from his bickering personalities. 	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_5_3_description	The Pirate King’s ambition to rule the waves puts him at odds with many rivals. All he can do is take it one battle at a time, until every land mass and ocean belongs to the Vampire Coast!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_1_2_description	Luthor’s murderous personalities might not always concur, but the one thing they can agree on is whether or not to attack when a target presents itself – the answer is often a resounding ‘yes’ from all sides.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_2_2_description	Despite his mental frailties, Luthor’s crew remain under his complete control, doing his bidding even though his spellcasting abilities are limited to keeping their bindings in place. Luthor must keep his crew’s numbers up, or risk being vulnerable in times when he loses his grip on reality.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_3_2_description	Luthor enjoys a good display of black powder might, so the more Cannonry Sheds under the control of the Vampire Coast, the better.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_4_2_description	The horde marches on, burning, pillaging, and amassing wealth. A little too much wealth to handle at once. Best free their rotting hands of all these sacks of loot!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_5_2_description	The lands and seas already cower at the terrible achievements of the Pirate King, but he can do so much worse… If only he could be in several places at once, and not just within his own mind!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_1_5_description	Once an unknown, worldly Vampire, Luthor Harkon now casts a dark, twitching shadow across the eastern coast of Lustria. The greater he becomes, the further his influence shall extend…	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_2_5_description	An extended life as a creature of the night has put Luthor Harkon in good stead for the challenges of piracy, but his ascendancy must continue – not even his warring personalities should hold him back!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_3_5_description	One way for Luthor to get around his lack of magical abilities is the use of rites. If only he can just steady himself a second to invoke one, perhaps some advantage can be gained?	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_4_5_description	He may be bereft of magical abilities, but Luthor is unequalled by most in his piratical cunning and Vampiric savagery. For Luthor’s personalities, there is great joy in being as murderous as he can be in his exploits, but he must prime himself for the much bigger battles to come.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_5_5_description	Lustria – nay, the world – shall quake in fear when they hear the name of the great Luthor Harkon. Yet still, his quest to dominate the ocean realm should continue, for never before has a Vampire achieved such seaborne hegemony.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_1_4_description	Harkon’s mind was broken by the seal of a Lizardmen temple – perhaps it can be repaired if he can just find some other titbit of information on the spells that took his power?	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_2_4_description	Luthor may be unstable, but the growth of his empire need not be. If the Vampire Coast's economy is sufficiently bolstered it can be sustained through even the most debilitating of the Pirate King’s schizophrenic episodes.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_3_4_description	Having several raging personalities is not an ideal situation when trying to be the most feared commander on the seas. If Luthor tries hard enough, he might just be able to focus on the things he needs to do long enough to actually do them!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_4_4_description	Death fills the air of the Vampire Coast, but for it to completely take root, more Vampiric corruption must saturate the land. Only then will it truly be a place for the dead, feared by all mortals.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_harkon_5_4_description	The amount of wealth a pirate owns is directly proportional to the strength of their force. A poor pirate may linger in obscurity until they eventually fall victim to a larger, richer foe. Harkon’s greed means that he rarely has cash flow problems to threaten his position at the top of the food chain.	true

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_1_1_description	The Emperor's banner should be seen in battle; after all, it was the backing of the Sigmarite Cult that won Karl Franz the throne, now he must be like the Warrior-King of old!   	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_2_1_description	In the quest to bring the Empire under Karl Franz's sway, overt diplomacy is not the only method - especially when an Elector or some other regional noble is publicly against him. There are more subtle ways to bring a region to heel. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_3_1_description	When Chaos comes or the Greenskins rampage, then borders become irrelevant. Mankind as a race has to come together. This must be achieved by any means necessary. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_4_1_description	A grand muster is called for. The full armoured might of the Empire should be deployed in all its awesome glory. Such a sight will make Ulric and Sigmar weep with joy and their enemies quail with fear. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_5_1_description	Not since the Time of Magnus has there been a greater muster; the armies of the Empire should come together at last, for we stand ready to fight the mightiest of battles. This will be a call to arms like no other! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_1_3_description	For the Empire to remain the mightiest of all nations then infrastructure is key. Ulric will be pleased with our Lord's prowess in battle, but there are many other gods to appease and raising great buildings and monuments is one way to achieve that. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_2_3_description	The greatest cities in the Old World reside in the Empire, they are full of danger and wonders, attracting visitors and great minds from across the world. To retain the influx of the great, the cities must prosper. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_3_3_description	The Empire is the greatest nation of the Old World. To retain such a title it needs to dazzle and impress and beguile visitors from all across the realms. Its cities are islands of stature in the vast wilderness of the nation, and the buildings within, jewels. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_4_3_description	The greater our most loyal servants become, the tighter the Emperor's rule. Elevate a Lord with power, wealth and influence so that Karl Franz's reign can never be gainsayed by enemies within or without. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_5_3_description	We must raise as many nobles to our circle of influence - make them the greatest they can be, for their loyalty will filter down to the men, girding them for the ultimate conquest. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_1_2_description	Every Emperor that takes the throne surrounds himself by men whose abilities and loyalty are as strong as the steel they carry. Recruit such a warrior. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_2_2_description	The Colleges of Magic were founded in the wake of the Great War Against Chaos and the coronation of Magnus the Pious. Never again would the Empire suffer at the magic of others. Now the Empire requires a student from the Colleges to accompany our forces.  	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_3_2_description	It is time our enemies knew what they stood against. An army of disciplined Men of the Empire in all their magnificent panoply will send a strong message through these lands. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_4_2_description	The Empire is an eclectic place full of many esoteric organisations - religious and otherwise. Such institutions hold a lot of sway, so their blessing is always a boon to any ruling Emperor. Having dominion over their headquarters certainly helps too... 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_5_2_description	The ultimate threat draws near, those institutions and temples not with us should be brought under our control. The Emperor cares not how this is achieved - offer the branch or the lash - we will have them under Karl Franz's will. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_1_5_description	The Emperor cannot reign over the entire nation without the backing of the Elector Counts, who rule their provinces autonomously. While belligerent Electors may need the threat of steel to come on side, others can be won over with the dove. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_2_5_description	A legendary quest fall upon our Lords - rewards and greatness awaits those brave enough to undertake such tasks, for they will be remembered in the annals of history. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_3_5_description	There is no stronger message to our foes than dominance on the battlefield. Victories are empty things if we lose too many of our own forces in the engagement. It is time to smash the foe, and have them fleeing before our armoured might.   	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_4_5_description	Although the Dwarfs will falsely claim otherwise, the Empire is the most technically able race in the world. Mankind willing innovates and is not moribund in tradition or the petty jealousies of the Dwarfen Guilds. We should exploit that. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_5_5_description	Ensure our greatest minds have stretched themselves. We must seek out every innovation not yet discovered, for this will give us an edge in the battles and conquest yet to play out. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_1_4_description	Assailed by enemies within and without, the Empire is cursed to never know true peace - but Karl Franz was elected Emperor on the promise of quelling the myriad foes, and so his campaign begins in earnest.  	true

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_3_4_description	The Emperor's influence spreads far across the lands and beyond our borders. Give loyal servants the authority to enact Franz's will against the enemies of Sigmar, so we can consolidate our power. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_empire_4_4_description	The Emperor has many willing servants; if loyal nobles are elevated to greatness, so, too, should those whose skills and influence lie in other disciplines. Make them great and their faith in Karl Franz will be swollen tenfold. 	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_1_3_description	When the Bloody Reaver appears, Count Noctilus’ soon-to-be victims know that it is the beginning of a living nightmare. The more lambs slaughtered by his dark armada, the more horrific Noctilus’ legend shall be.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_2_3_description	Count Noctilus does not go to war to take captives, for he has no use for living vessels. To him, a fleshy body is much more useful once its soul has left its body. Therefore, a fight with Noctilus can never end in an opponent’s surrender – only death.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_3_3_description	As Noctilus’ ocean empire exerts more control in the world, the need for formidable deputies to do his bidding increases. Whether they are willingly loyal or magically bound to his will, it matters not.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_4_3_description	That which lies in the world’s treasure chests is destined for Noctilus’ coffers! So speaks the Lord of the Dreadfleet!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_5_3_description	The Devil makes work for idle hands, but what of the Devil himself? What of his own hands? To what dread and fell end have they been purposed?	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_1_2_description	There is only one way for a great conjurer such as Count Noctilus to flex his Necromantic muscles – by spreading death and making corpses, for which battle is a best facilitator!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_2_2_description	Already one of the most powerful conjurers to take to the seas, Noctilus’ swarms of Undead are capable of changing this world forever. He only needs to continue to bolster his numbers to ensure that he leaves every battle victorious.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_3_2_description	Count Noctilus is a most brutal commander, but one who never over-thinks a battle. When it comes to artillery, it’s simple: bigger guns in more numbers make it much easier to annihilate your enemies.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_4_2_description	Destruction and murder can sometimes be an expensive business, so Count Noctilus makes sure the loot is always taken. The Galleon’s Graveyard is not really the best place to store it all, however, being a corpse-strewn morass.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_5_2_description	Noctilus’ will to despoil is unrelenting, but his horde is now too numerous. The important task of leading his crew into the next phase of his apocalyptic ambitions will have to be partially entrusted to the most powerful among his subordinates.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_1_1_description	Noctilus wishes nothing but to conjure up death wherever he roams, terrorising the sheep of both land and sea. Though unequalled in his expertise in destruction, he can always do with more tools and knowledge to achieve his evil ends.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_2_1_description	Ships, armies, settlements – anything is a potential target for Noctilus to extract riches from. On his word, the cutlasses and pistols of his Undead crew can be drawn for an instant campaign of raiding and despoilment.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_3_1_description	Noctilus is ruthless in his efforts to take advantage of the wealth the sea provides. By stockpiling a vast fortune of plundered loot, his path to domination will be made all the easier.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_4_1_description	The bigger Count Noctilus’ hordes get, the more the balance of power on the oceans will continue to shift in his favour.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_5_1_description	Noctilus’ ambitions to crush whichever target he sets his mind upon are boundless. He knows very well that by summoning every available corpse to his cause, there can be none that could effectively stand against him.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_1_5_description	Having done away with the shackles of his squabbling bloodline, Count Noctilus is now free to spread terror wherever the Bloody Reaver takes him, pursuing greatness through his ruinous exploits.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_2_5_description	Noctilus brings morbid dread to anyone and anything unlucky to be in his path of destruction. The more he kills and pillages, the greater a threat he is to the world.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_3_5_description	Any ritual that can serve the nefarious ends of Count Noctilus, he welcomes, but he is no cheap conjurer. The Curse of the Sea Mist is a powerful enchantment that is both offensive and defensive, and one he knows can do extensive damage to his enemies. 	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_4_5_description	With a trail of carnage left in his wake, Count Noctilus sails on as his enemies tremble at his ascendancy. One by one they shall continue to fall, as the commander of the Dreadfleet fast becomes the deadliest creature upon the seas.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_5_5_description	With unparalleled levels of Necromantic control boosted by the power of the Galleon’s Graveyard, Noctilus is master of his seaborne eldritch empire. Yet still, he can become ever greater – until every soul upon the sea exists in servitude to him, he will not rest!	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_3_4_description	Count Noctilus might not believe in destiny, but does staunchly believe in his own – to ascend to a position of supreme power. There are many possible paths to this end, some more difficult than others, but all potentially offering rewards if seen through to the bitter end.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_4_4_description	The screams of captives emanate from the Galleon’s Graveyard, for Count Noctilus likes to keep the living spoils of battle to feed his zombies and other monstrous things – but mostly for a supply of living bodies to kill and raise.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_noctilus_5_4_description	Everywhere he goes, Noctilus makes enemies. He would have it no other way – if he did not relentlessly wage war, how would he find all the soulless servants to do his bidding?	true

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_1_1_description	Queek Headtaker is arguably the most powerful Skaven in the thirteen clans. His rise to power is built on butchery and cruelty without cessation, and an unrivalled rage that drives him ever onwards.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_2_1_description	Queek is accompanied in most battles by his elite cadre of Stormvermin, clad in recognisable blood-scarlet robes. However, Queek likes nothing more than to get amongst the throng and cause wanton death and bloodshed personally.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_3_1_description	Queek Headtaker has achieved victory and glory through sheer tenacity. It is not he who led the attacks on the Karak Eight Peaks, but such was his sustained conviction and violence, he was granted first scavenge rights, essentially cementing him as the battle's legend.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_4_1_description	To say that Gnawdwell relies on Queek would be an understatement. Although the Warlord keeps Queek busy out of self-preservation, he is also paradoxically reliant on his underling's cruelty and barbaric success in battle.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_5_1_description	When Queek scurries to the battlefield, he does so with only one purpose; to destroy. No enemy can stand against his rage and his cruelty. When the fighting is done, and the battle is littered with enemy dead and dying, then Queek sets himself to feasting.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_1_2_description	The bulk of Queek's achievements were scored underground, against rival clans and Dwarfen expeditions. Those who follow him now know that he will surely replicate these barbaric successes on the surface.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_2_2_description	Queek Headtaker's prowess in the Underway is so legendary that they call him the Dwarf-Smiter. So cruel is his torture of his victims that they call him the Headtaker. Yet he is ultimately just Queek, the Skaven warrior par excellence, always hungry for the next battle.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_3_2_description	One does not get the epithet "Headtaker" or "Dwarf-Smiter" through paltry encounters. Queek has stormed to victory with a zeal that sends enemies fleeing for their lives, broken before the fury of the Warlord of Clan Mors.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_4_2_description	Even amongst the Skaven, Queek is renowned as unusually cruel. He takes endless delight in death and destruction, greedily slaking his hunger on countless enemies that fall to his frenzied attacks.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_5_2_description	Throughout the Under-Empire, they speak with hushed respect of Queek Headtaker's deeds.

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_1_3_description	All Skaven are greedy, self-interested bundles of furry ego. Their desire for strength and wealth almost outweighs their desire for bloodshed and destruction. Yet even in the midst of bloodlust, the price of war must be paid.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_2_3_description	The Skaven are ingenious engineers, always finding new and terrifying ways to wage war. Be it the creation of new weapons, or dangerous Warpstone alchemy, the Skaven are unafraid to risk everything in the name of an edge in the next battle.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_3_3_description	The Skaven take everything they want. Not content to play by the conventional methods of the surface-dwellers, the Skaven will swarm across the land, picking it dry and living off the spoils of war.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_4_3_description	Behind their twitching snouts and glowing eyes, the Skaven possess cunning little brains, capable of devising ingenious and terrifying inventions. The engineers of the Skaven slave away below the surface, only emerging when they have something truly ingenious to display.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_5_3_description	The Skaven take what they need, and indeed what they want, both from their enemies and from each other. The ratmen are not bound by conventional notions of property, and survive by stealing, raiding and coveting what they have to.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_1_4_description	They speak of Skaven in hushed tones on the surface, so unwilling are people to believe that an apocalyptic threat exists beneath their feet.

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_2_4_description	Queek's cruelty is so vast that he demands trophies from his battles.

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_4_4_description	Though the Dwarfs are aware that the Skaven exist, the rest of the surface-dwellers refuse to accept it. Only the miserable, doomed slaves that get carted down to the Under-Empire know, but by then it is far too late…	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_5_4_description	Those damned cretins dragged from their homes to be slaves for the ratmen await a fate worse than death.

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_1_5_description	Queek Headtaker, as the 'trusted' general of Warlord Gnawdwell, is dispatched on missions at his master's leisure. Such affairs keep Queek occupied and, so Gnawdwell believes, stops him from plotting to take his position.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_2_5_description	The Headtaker accepts any mission issued him by his overlords, for he knows it keeps him inconspicuous. Yet Queek did not rise to such a powerful position through subservience, oh no…	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_3_5_description	Queek is not a rat who denies a challenge, be that from his enemies or from Warlord Gnawdwell himself. Whenever there is glory to be gained, Queek will be there, ripping apart any who would deny him.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_4_5_description	The only thing greater than Queek Headtaker's cruelty is his ego, which is immense. The lengths that the Warlord will go to for his own personal fulfilment is legendary, indicated by the trail of battered and bloodied Skaven corpses in his wake.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_queek_5_5_description	Let no Skaven say that Queek Headtaker is not an industrious leader. Though he always seeks glory and power, he has nevertheless led the Skaven to glory after glory in their eternal war against the surface-dwellers	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_2_5_description	The Liche Priests are respected throughout Nehekhara. Even the Tomb Kings themselves will listen to their Liche advisors. The Cult must remain relevant to ensure its power in the Land of the Dead and beyond.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_3_5_description	It is in Khatep's interest to find the Legions of Legend, or have the Mortuary Cult fashion an item of great power to lead the exiles to victory. He must order his dead-but-not-died brethren within the Cult to act.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_2_4_description	The Liche Lord has need of his vestments of power. He must seek out what is lost to him, for the power of the Mortuary Cult will suffer if their Grand Hierophant is not prepared.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_1_3_description	The Dark Ones despise the Liche Lord's presence and it is only a matter of time before they strike at the exiles as intruders. But like most unwelcome guests, Khatep should refuse to leave… by taking ownership of Clar Karond.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_5_3_description	The Black Pyramid, the greatest legacy of Nagash, hums to life and so it must be taken. If the King of Kings has no use for it, then the Mortuary Cult can certainly plunder the secrets within.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_1_2_description	Many rites require salt; a humble mineral to many but its properties are undisputed by ancients and mystics across the world.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_2_2_description	After centuries of a nomadic existence, the accumulation of salt and timber are resources needed for strong foundations… for permanence and a strong base.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_3_2_description	Elements, minerals and furs are not always things required by immortals, but they are a means to an end… trade them with the living; let them squander such wealth on mortal desires if it suits the Liche Lord's purpose.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_4_2_description	To the long-dead, the resources that the living crave are mere trinkets. But depriving the enemy - living or dead - of them, does indeed give these resources value.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_5_2_description	The dead do not just harvest the bodies of their foes, for the Tomb Kings, and Khatep especially, may have use for the myriad other resources that mortals desire.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_3_1_description	As the oldest and most experienced of all Liche Priests, there is none more knowledgeable within the Mortuary Cult… however even the Grand Hierophant still has things to learn and knowledge to attain. The gods parcel our such lore infrequently.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_4_1_description	As Khatep's legions grow, so he must learn new skills to lead rather than merely advise. And so it is, he should attain the 24th rank.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_khatep_5_1_description	A Liche of Khatep's age and power does not have many avenues of knowledge left to explore. But then even a creature like the Liche Lord cannot rival the gods… or can he?	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_1_3_description	Aranessa may be unaccustomed to it, but being served by Undead crewmen is a win-win situation. She only needs to keep killing her enemies to ensure her ratings stay filled.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_2_3_description	Those who know the most famous pirate in Sartosa know that only the open ocean and the glitter of gems can melt her famous scowl. Pirates with such an affinity for jewels can always do with extra places to store their loot. 	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_3_3_description	No woman is an island, even Captain Saltspite; Aranessa will always go it alone at the top of her pirate empire, but as it grows she needs more trusted officers to help oversee things.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_4_3_description	They say Aranessa’s fiery personality can be fast appeased by the glitter of jewels. To put her on the trail of treasure is to entice the Queen of Tides with the possibility that she may be able to accumulate more shiny things.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_5_3_description	Aranessa’s reputation is now such that no-one feels safe on the seas anymore. The more victories she accumulates, the closer she comes to becoming a living legend – as opposed to an Undead one.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_1_2_description	A swashbuckler at heart, Aranessa commands a crew of dirty fighters who are the scourge of any defender, but only through further skirmishes can they become an even more formidable force.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_2_2_description	A seasoned commander of sailors like Aranessa knows that no one crewman is stronger than the collective crew, regardless of a foe’s strength, and a bigger crew is better than a smaller one. 	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_3_2_description	Having survived her fair share of sea battles, Aranessa is well-schooled in the tactics of broadside skirmishing. The biggest challenge, however, is being able to provide her crew with enough cannons of sufficient quality in the first place.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_4_2_description	A problem often faced by successful pirates like Aranessa is that eventually the holds of their ships cannot possibly contain all their wealth, so they must resort to stashing it somewhere safe on land. 	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_5_2_description	No pirate can be in every part of the sea at once c not even Aranessa Saltspite – so it falls to her admirals to execute her will. But with so much now at stake, no normal admirals will do… 	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_1_1_description	Aranessa is as willing to cut someone’s throat for their jewels and gems as much as the next pirate, but often the greatest treasure is knowledge once forgotten, unearthed anew.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_2_1_description	Plundering is just part and parcel of being a pirate, with booty changing hands whenever Aranessa sees the opportunity. Besides, if blood is spilt in her pursuit for loot, there’s always the chance that the previous owners get to keep a share, since they may get to join the Swordfysh’s crew.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_3_1_description	Pots of gold everywhere and the hold rammed to the gills with filthy lucre! Amassing wealth is what being a pirate is all about, and there are a few things Aranessa likes more than having the Swordfysh’s hold full of booty. 	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_4_1_description	Although never entirely comfortable with the Unliving, Aranessa is no fool, seeing the advantage in controlling swarms of zombie crewmen and other Undead monstrosities. A larger headcount of both shall ensure the annihilation of anyone who opposes her.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_5_1_description	Captain Saltspite seeks to legitimise her claim of being the Queen of Pirates, once and for all.

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_1_5_description	It is said that Captain Saltspite rose fully grown out of the waves in a froth of gore, and has saltwater running through her veins. Her current burgeoning status surely affirms her destiny!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_2_5_description	Aranessa’s exploits up until now have been nothing less than would be expected from one who is allegedly the spawn of the Sea-God himself. Further successes will lead her to true greatness!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_3_5_description	Though usually not all that concerned by matters of magic, Aranessa has seen the power of rituals and curses before, and has no fear of using them.

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_4_5_description	Saltspite’s vocation is to rule the waves as the self-styled 'Pirate Queen', who always draws first blood in her pursuit of booty.

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_5_5_description	Captain Aranessa Saltspite shall be a name which reverberates around every ocean of the world, instilling fear in the hearts of all who take to the sea without the permission and favour of the great Sea-God.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_1_4_description	The seas and coastlines provide a handsome living for those who live upon the waves. For a legendary pirate like Aranessa Saltspite, a raiding campaign to fill the Swordfysh’s coffers never goes amiss.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_2_4_description	One does not become the most famous pirate in Sartosa without good business acumen. A pirate empire, albeit one that runs on robbing and racketeering, still needs its coffers to be regularly filled.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_3_4_description	Aranessa is a pirate who has always kept herself busy and one step ahead of her enemies, knowing that the difference between success and failure is preparation for the right course of action.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_4_4_description	Captives can be worth their weight in gold, but the abilities bestowed on Aranessa that allow her to muster the Undead also make them useful to her in death.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_BONUS_aranessa_5_4_description	Some of the world’s greatest pirates are also the world’s most vicious slave drivers, but such a business is unsustainable without taking prisoners of war and putting them to work in your service.	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_2_1_description	The world was once riven by Chaos; torn asunder by powers beyond mortal understanding. And so the Beastmen strive to return the world to such a state, one ruined landscape at a time.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_3_1_description	Even when the land is cracked and broken, when the world's life seeps from every pore and fissure, still the Beastmen will not stop. They will raid, they will fight, and they will despoil it all.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_4_1_description	Everything has its price. Even the Beastmen, who deride 'civilised' notions of society and wealth, must pay one another in kind. Bones, flesh, stolen crops, ash, blood - all are valuable to some beast, somewhere.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_5_1_description	At the very end of all things, when Chaos purges the world of its hope and vitality, the Beastmen will know they played their part in its destruction and be proud.	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_3_3_description	Mankind knows the threat posed by the Beastmen is real, and ever growing. Only through unity do they foolishly think they can halt this tide of madness. All band together to face the herd, yet it can never be enough.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_4_3_description	A herd without enemies is a herd without purpose. When resting, they think only of war, when feasting they think only of greater battles. The world is full of enemies to destroy, and the Beastmen WILL destroy them.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_5_3_description	Even when the world goes to rack and ruin, still some will fight in desperate, pitiful hope. They, too, will be washed away in a tide of blood before the Beastmen's calamitous vengeance.	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_2_2_description	Though the herd knows the power and rage of direct assault best of all, there is utility in the machinations of a Bray-Shaman, or the direct, single combat of a towering Gorebull.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_3_2_description	Praying before great herdstones in the centre of their forest homes, the Beastmen call for the strength to sweep away mankind, performing acts of such heresy that the portends of these dark deeds are felt behind man's 'impenetrable' walls.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_4_2_description	At the head of the herd is the Beastlord, a powerful creature whose demonstrations of raw power have ensured his ascension. None dare oppose him, lest they can overpower his savage might.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_5_2_description	Great herds are led by great Beastlords; those who can weather the trials and tribulations that the herd suffer. Hatred leading hatred; there is no greater strength.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_1_5_description	The stunted Greenskins are lurid and irrelevant, but they have some tenacity. The herd has no time for unworthy distractions - it would be better to scour them from the land entirely.	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_4_5_description	The failing world of man will know the touch of Ruin too when the Beastmen destroy their homes and conquer their lands in the name of Chaos. The Uncloven Ones will know the hideous touch of the Dark Gods.	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_2_4_description	The herd must grow ever stronger. Worshipping before the herdstone, feasting beneath the forest canopy, the Beastmen grow ever greater in numbers, quenching their hunger for flesh and for war.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_3_4_description	Every beast knows that, for their efforts, they will be rewarded by the Dark Gods.

mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_malagor_4_4_description	The Beastmen hate mankind and anything else that dares to get in their way. Their bitterness is unmatched, their hatred unparalleled. Across the Old World, there are none who hate and war as much as the warherds.	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_1_1_description	Bring bloodshed and misery to those that stand against the Greenskins. Wurrzag does not only expect victory, he has foreseen it. Such prophecies do not tolerate failure. Gottit, you git? Good.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_2_1_description	Wurrzag has always travelled alone, inspiring tribes and then moving on after a time. But now is not the time to be a loner - the world needs dominating, and if he wants to be part of it, he needs to start mobbing-up!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_3_1_description	As much as Wurrzag would revel in turning all his enemies to dust by himself, even he knows he needs da boyz behind him to destroy them all in short order. The call has gone out, and the mobs are coming.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_4_1_description	The Waaagh! gathers pace! The enemies of the Greenskins - that's everyone without green skin (well, even a few Greenskins to be honest) - will witness a mob like never before. Da Great Ruckus begins! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_5_1_description	An unending tide of green - a mass mob of Orcs and Goblins that would make Gork and Mork swell with pride and send Sigmar and his cronies cowering into the Realm of Chaos! That is the goal, now it's time to bring it! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_1_3_description	Time to rampage - winning in battle is one thing but a Greenskin's career is all about the lootin' too. Sack and raze enemy settlements - let the foe know that Wurrzag and his boyz are coming!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_2_3_description	If their enemies do not fear the Greenskins, then how can they be dominated? Dish out some serious damage. Start sacking and looting in the name of Gork (or Mork)!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_3_3_description	More ravaging is needed, our foes still have hope, some even think they can beat us! That needs taking from them - see to it! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_4_3_description	Wurrzag has no mates, save for Gork (or Mork) of course. He tolerates those around him as he elevates them to greatness. Yet for the Waaagh! to be successful, Wurrzag must give the brutes below him more power, as he cannot do everything himself.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_5_3_description	Grant the most able Warbosses and magic-users in the Greenskin ranks the power and status they need to bring about a slaughter. It is what Gork demands, and Wurrzag knows it is necessary!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_1_2_description	The gobbos are revolting… in many ways, but they need bringing to heel, or Wurrzag will just turn the lot of 'em into Squigs. Pick a Boss from their disgusting ranks and make him a 'Big Boss'; maybe then they'll behave?	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_2_2_description	Magic is tricky thing. A few of the enemy wizards are quite good at it! Fortunately, Mork and  Gork can provide; Wurrzag has been gifted with such magical abilities, and some other gobbos and Orcs can fling a good spell too! Find a Goblin Shaman - they're usually cheaper and easier to bully.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_3_2_description	While spells of da Little Waaagh! are already at our disposal, it's time to get some of the "bigga spellz" in play. Maybe a foot or fist of Gork to really wind the enemy up? Go and find an Orc Shaman.  	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_4_2_description	The true horror of the Greenskin menace is not always seen on the battlefield but in the devastation left in the wake of the Orc ravagers. They are merciless, and often hungry as they scourge enemy ruins. Be merciless, be more Orc! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_5_2_description	Destroy! We must unleash the beast that lies within every Greenskin. The Orc Gods want this world to tremble, and so our Savage Lord must be "Da Scourge" and burn a scar across the lands that not even time will forget! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_1_5_description	The boyz need more than just prophecies and promises - they need loot! Even Wurrzag needs loot - every git needs loot! So they better find it; a good few raids should sort out the cash flow.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_2_5_description	Orcs will travel leagues to join a burgeoning Waaagh!, but they won't come for just any Warboss. They are attracted to those favoured by the Gods, by those whose legends are created by the quests they undertake. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_3_5_description	It ain't cheap keeping all these armies - Orcs are greedy gits that are always after loot and shiny stuff. It might be best to replenish "da cofferz" - a few raids should do the job. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_4_5_description	The best and shiniest stuff… the loot that can make the eyes of the hardiest Warboss water, is rarely in the neighbouring location. The boyz are going to have to loot deep into enemy territory to get the good stuff!   	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_5_5_description	Even for Orcs, the lure of shiny stuff is as strong as the thrill of murder - the richest Bosses are always the most successful. If Wurrzag is to bring about Ragnarork, then he must become the wealthiest Greenskin as well.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_1_4_description	Nothing pleases an Orc than being part of a big green mob, mindlessly charging into the enemy. But war is rarely that simple, even the Greenskins know this; sometimes though, somewhat annoyingly, a more strategic approach is needed.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_2_4_description	Wurrzag is eager to enact the prophecies he has seen, yet there are things that need doing in preparation for the big charge. Get 'em done, and keep Wurrzag happy.	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_4_4_description	Wurrzag is in the business of empowering the Greenskins to do Gork's (or Mork's) dark work, and he knows that he needs the Bosses and Shamans around him to enact their will. Give them yet more power so that they may serve da Great Green Godz.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_wurrzag_5_4_description	Wurrzag's most feared subjects need not only his backing so they can go about unimpeded, but if they are to spread the word of Da Great Green Prophet's Waaagh! then they must be granted the power such a message demands!	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_1_5_description	Before the brayherd, there can be no victory, and there is certainly no quarter. Khazrak's rage at man is unending; capitulation before the herd is simply a self-signed sentence of death.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_2_5_description	The Beastmen are the unholy hybrid of man and beast, born from the rending of the world and the emergence of Chaos. Ruinous corruption seeps from them, pervading every inch of land that they scour.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_3_5_description	Corruption courses through the Beastmen as surely as the blood flows through their veins. It is this Chaotic corruption that drives them forward to greater, darker, and ever more twisted deeds.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_4_5_description	The failing world of man will know the touch of Ruin too when the Beastmen destroy their homes and conquer their lands in the name of Chaos. The Uncloven Ones will know the hideous touch of the Dark Gods.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_5_5_description	The Beastmen will dive into the very earth itself to fight new enemies, and have fought under stone, forest and sky. Those dwelling on the land are nothing before their might - they are powerless before the fury of the herd.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_1_4_description	Much labour to do-do. Many tunnels to gnaw, Warpstone to mine. Slaves are needed and not just Skaven ones. Any will do.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_2_4_description	In the aftermath of battle the Black Hunger falls upon the Skaven - a ravenous need to consume. But you must halt the natural instincts of your kin, we need captives not food.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_3_4_description	Tretch's great undertakings continue to consume many slaves. Always more captives are needed, for there are many labours to enact!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_4_4_description	As the population grows, so to must its infrastructure. Slaves of no-furs should be put top work at once.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_5_4_description	The workhouses of Clan Rictus constantly churn through Skavenslaves and any no-fur captives. But the wheels of empire cannot be stopped this close to prominence. More captives are needed. Don't eat them, use them!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_1_4_description	The forces of mankind line up before Khazrak, in defiance of his rule and in defence of their pitiful cities. Yet the One-Eye does not fear men and their walls, for he is gifted with the blessings of Ruin.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_2_4_description	The herd must grow ever stronger. Worshipping before the herdstone, feasting beneath the forest canopy, the Beastmen grow ever greater in numbers, quenching their hunger for flesh and for war.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_3_4_description	Every beast knows that, for their efforts, they will be rewarded by the Dark Gods.

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_2_1_description	Status and power are everything to Skaven. They lust after it and wield it to control the masses. Should Tretch reach the 13th rank of consciousness, then all will be forced to bow their whiskers to his greatness!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_3_1_description	Tretch's domination of the clan continues to bloat, despite lacking the intimidating presence of many peers who have gained a similar status. This will no doubt infuriate rivals, so Craventail must ensure his status continues to rise.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_4_1_description	Craventail's power is not yet at its peak. May the Horned Rat continue to bless this Skaven.	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_1_1_description	Beastmen despise the notion of civilisation that man so adores. The land is fit only for reaping - to be despoiled and gorged upon. And so the herd ravages the land, claiming it for themselves.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_2_1_description	The world was once riven by Chaos; torn asunder by powers beyond mortal understanding. And so the Beastmen strive to return the world to such a state, one ruined landscape at a time.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_3_1_description	Even when the land is cracked and broken, when the world's life seeps from every pore and fissure, still the Beastmen will not stop. They will raid, they will fight, and they will despoil it all.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_4_1_description	Everything has its price. Even the Beastmen, who deride 'civilised' notions of society and wealth, must pay one another in kind. Bones, flesh, stolen crops, ash, blood - all are valuable to some beast, somewhere.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_5_1_description	At the very end of all things, when Chaos purges the world of its hope and vitality, the Beastmen will know they played their part in its destruction and be proud.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_2_3_description	While Tretch may now be the most curious of ratmen, he understands - in a base way - that knowledge and innovation can lead to power over rivals and enemies.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_3_3_description	Set your minions to spreading filth across the lands, have them raid and steal. Take-take-TAKE!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_4_3_description	It is not only Clan Skryre that can dominate the technical advances of the Skaven. Rictus should and will be part of the answer.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_5_3_description	Tretch should send the rats of Clan Rictus on the ultimate raid. Gathering all the Warptokens, Warpstone and other no-fur trinkets they find.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_1_3_description	The herd is a mighty, unruly clamour of untempered wills, furious temperaments and single-minded hatred of mankind. Unusually, disunity is their greatest strength - the larger the herd, the greater the force they bring to bear.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_2_3_description	It is not only man for whom the Beastmen's rage burns. The world itself inflames their ire, and anything that walks upon it - man OR beast - risks a reckoning with the herd, overwrought with unquenchable fury.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_3_3_description	Mankind knows the threat posed by the Beastmen is real, and ever growing. Only through unity do they foolishly think they can halt this tide of madness. All band together to face the herd, yet it can never be enough.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_4_3_description	A herd without enemies is a herd without purpose. When resting, they think only of war, when feasting they think only of greater battles. The world is full of enemies to destroy, and the Beastmen WILL destroy them.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_5_3_description	Even when the world goes to rack and ruin, still some will fight in desperate, pitiful hope. They, too, will be washed away in a tide of blood before the Beastmen's calamitous vengeance.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_1_2_description	Clan Rictus supreme! Make war, reap slaves, kill enemy-foes.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_2_2_description	Only a great general can win many-many battles. Such war leaders tend to lead from the front… well, that's how they do it in other races, Tretch's methods should be more craven.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_3_2_description	There are whispers in the ranks. According to a few 'tattle-tails', some Clawleaders proclaim that Tretch actually hides or avoids battle. Craventail must prove this is untrue. Not only must he claim victory, but the win should be by more than a mere whisker!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_4_2_description	5,000: that is the corpses required by the Council to prove that progress has been made. Any less and Tretch risks disappointing Lord Doomclaw. 	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_BONUS_tretch_5_2_description	Reap a mighty toll against all the enemies of Clan Rictus. A great soul harvest will ensure Tretch's ascendancy to greatness. Yes-yes!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_1_2_description	What dark and devious machinations do the Bray-Shamans devise? What brutality can the Gorebull wreak? Ahead of the vanguard, in amongst the foe, they demonstrate their terrible abilities and sow the seeds of man's destruction.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_2_2_description	Though the herd knows the power and rage of direct assault best of all, there is utility in the machinations of a Bray-Shaman, or the direct, single combat of a towering Gorebull.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_3_2_description	Praying before great herdstones in the centre of their forest homes, the Beastmen call for the strength to sweep away mankind, performing acts of such heresy that the portends of these dark deeds are felt behind man's 'impenetrable' walls.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_khazrak_4_2_description	At the head of the herd is the Beastlord, a powerful creature whose demonstrations of raw power have ensured his ascension. None dare oppose him, lest they can overpower his savage might.	true

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_1_5_description	Some of the younger generation of Dwarf Engineers are beginning to research and 'innovate'. This doesn't sit well with the traditionalists in the Engineers' Guild, but the High King needs such inquisitive minds in the wars ahead.  	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_2_5_description	Dwarfs put great stock in the telling of tales, be they sung or recounted in verse. Our Lords need to become like warriors of myth by forging their own legends. For in doing so the Dwarf folk will follow them into the End Times and beyond!  	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_3_5_description	To Valaya's sorrow, the Dwarf race is one in decline, the older folk outnumber the younger beardlings by some margin. So each Dwarf death is a blow to the High King. He must win his battles but do so convincingly, by slaying the foe and keeping his kin alive! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_4_5_description	Despite claims from the Empire and the stubbornness of the traditionalists, Dwarfs are the most technically-able race.

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_2_4_description	Each grudge against the Dwarfs is a link in a chain that weighs all of Dwarfkind down. Belegar and his kin must break those chains, and set Dwarfen-folk free!	true

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_4_4_description	The Age of Reckoning is upon the Dwarfs, and many heroes will be forged, their sagas to be sung in drinking halls for the rest of time. Such heroes should be found and raised to greatness, for they can only aid the cause.	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_5_4_description	It is a time of heroes, an age not seen since Grimnir led great warriors in battle. Grudgebearer must bring about such an era, or make his kin believe it is so. The High King should empower such heroes - raise them to greatness!  	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_1_3_description	During the Golden Age, many wonders of the Old World were Dwarf-built and hidden under the mountains. Let the Dwarfs bring about such an age again.	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_2_3_description	There is no definitive rule that marks out the Greatholds from the Dwarfholds. It could be argued that it's the Clansfolk that inhabit the Holds, or the great monuments and halls. Whatever the definition, more Greatholds can only make the Karaz Ankor grow in power. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_3_3_description	Karaz-a-Karak is the greatest Hold and capital of the Karaz Ankor and seat of the High King since the time before time. Could another Dwarfhold one day rival Everpeak itself? Doubtful. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_4_3_description	The Royal Dwarf Clans are full of gifted Thanes and Riks, ready to take control of the High King's throngs. Such Lords must be empowered so they are ready to lead, even as the urks approach their doors.	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_5_3_description	The final battle is upon the Dwarfs - the great war of vengeance that will see all other races bow before their might. But the High King cannot do this alone, he must ensure his closest allies are at their most powerful.	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_1_2_description	The throngs need leading - go forth into the deeps and find a Thane of Royal blood. Find a grim sort to lead the Clansdwarfs to war!	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_2_2_description	A sad indictment of the Karaz Ankor is that many a Dwarfhold's Sacred Forge remains unlit, the holy fires burning low or extinguished altogether. It is time they grew bright once more, with a Runesmith hammering at the hearth. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_3_2_description	Nothing fills Dwarfish hearts than seeing brave, bearded warriors with axes in hand, march out to war. A mighty throng is an army that any foe will dread to face! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_4_2_description	The Dwarfholds are all independent kingdoms that pay tribute to the High King, even if they do not always directly obey. Should our Lord directly influence a great or unique institution then his reign will be all the more effective. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_5_2_description	As victory for good or not draws close, the High King's influence should be as unyielding as Dwarfen steel. Owning powerful Institutions and Guilds, instead of the Clans, gives Thorgrim an edge that will keep all grumblers in line.	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_1_1_description	Any Dwarfhold worth its foundations must be able to fill its vaults with gold. Debt is for the beardless! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_2_1_description	With the High King's tacit permission, the innovators faction within the Engineers' Guild are starting to actually invent things! The traditionalists are in uproar, but the Age of Reckoning will be won in part with new methods, not stagnation! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_3_1_description	Even the traditionalists of the Engineers' Guild have been won over by this new outlook of improving and iterating on the concepts of the older generations. Continue the engineering renaissance!  	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_4_1_description	In the Golden Age, Dwarf throngs comprising thousands of beards would regularly march between Holds, scattering Beastmen and Greenskins alike. While such a sight is much rarer these days, it is surely one to make even the most obstinate Rik proud. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_dwarf_5_1_description	Not since the War of the Beard… since when the Ancestor Gods walked among the mountain folk… has an army as grand marched forth. The Age of Reckoning is now, the Dammaz Kron wiped clean! 	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc03_objective_MAIN_beastmen_2_mini_description	The worshippers of this 'wolf god' desperately attempt to bring order to a world riven by madness, a world deserving of naught but havoc. Bring that havoc to the world. Let fire consume it all.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_dlc09_settra_3_description	Now is the moment for the King of Kings to expand his domain. The world is a cauldron of war and instability begging for the dominance of Settra to bring order. Make it so.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_1_4_description	The mutated and savage herds of the Beastmen have long been a stain on the forest, and its inhabitants have long undertaken to purge them from the boughs. Yet they return, again and again, to bring havoc to the glades.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_2_4_description	The spirits and wraiths of Athel Loren draw great strength from the forest itself, and focus that power into the destruction of its enemies. When the forest unites, none can stand against it.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_3_4_description	The spirits of Athel Loren, if powerful enough, irrevocably merge themselves with its trees. These 'Treemen' are caring and beloved by all Athel Loren, yet strike out with savagery at those who would harm the forest.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_4_4_description	Those who defend the realms of Athel Loren do so with a preternatural power. Waystalkers shadow their targets and eliminate them with ruthless efficiency, whilst Branchwraiths are unmatched in their murderous abilities.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_dlc09_settra_2_description	Khemri has ever-been the greatest city and capital of Nehekhara. To let such status wane would taint not only the city but mighty Settra as well. The city must expand beyond its traditional borders. Any in the path of expansion must submit and give unquestioning allegiance to Khemri and its king, or feel his wrath.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_1_5_description	What Ariel dreams, the Asrai create. Athel Loren is a mystical place, but an industrious one, where Elves toil under lightless canopies to ever improve themselves, and be ever better than the perfidious outsiders.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_2_5_description	Durthu sees the defence of the forest as his sacred duty - a quest above and beyond all others. To hold Athel Loren against any foe, any would-be danger, he would tear the Old World asunder!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_3_5_description	Both the Elves and Athel Loren's forest spirits are unified in their hatred of the Beastmen. Both would like nothing more than to see their Ruinous blight scoured from the world. To that end, they fight relentlessly to completely erase the menace of the herd.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_4_5_description	Athel Loren must never relent in its march of progress. No other race in the world can match the inhabitants of the forest for intelligence, ingenuity and wherewithal. Long may that be so!	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_1_1_description	Athel Loren is the borderland between Bretonnia and the Empire, possessed of a mystical guile and nuance that leaves both befuddled before it. Yet within, everything moves as it should. The gears of economy must continue to grind.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_2_1_description	The boundaries of the Athel Loren are ever expanding, pushing against the Waystone fence that contains the forest. So too do the Asrai, wishing to expand their influence and push back against interlopers from without.	true

mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_1_2_description	Athel Loren provides for those who endeavour to become one with the forest. Such are the Spellsingers; mages of singular power and raw magical energy, drawn from the heart of Athel Loren itself.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_2_2_description	Before the Elves came to Athel Loren, it was the Branchwraiths who ruled the forests.

mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_4_2_description	The forests of Athel Loren are a patchwork of hidden constructions.

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_dlc09_settra_4_description	It is said that every man has a master - be it a parent, a superior, a lord or even a god. But not Settra - he serves none but himself and has done for eternity. For he is the King of Kings and so all other kings must bow to him. Yet there are still those who shun his greatness. Capture such wayward settlements, so their denizens can be corrected!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_1_3_description	When Durthu, Eldest of Ancients, strides to war, the forest strides with him. Ancient trees and vengeful spirits awaken to accompany the venerable Treeman to battle, to protect Athel Loren against any and all incursions.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_2_3_description	The Wood Elves permit very few outsiders into the forest, and repulse many more. Greenskins are no exception. Treacherous, thieving reprobates, the Orcs and Goblins of the nearby mountains are detested by the Asrai for their many treasons and general filth.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_3_3_description	Those who dwell too long alone with the trees lose something of themselves to the forest. So it is with the Waystalkers; solitary and taciturn hunters - masterful archers consumed, almost entirely, by the will of the forest.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc05_objective_BONUS_durthu_4_3_description	Athel Loren is divided into many realms. Some that languish in eternal sunlight, some in eternal darkness. All are ruled by Glade Lords and the Treemen of the forest; it is they who lead their companions into the fray.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_1_2_description	The gobbos are revolting… in many ways, but they need bringing to heel - Skarsnik has put down many a rebellion in bloody misery, but this might require a less violent touch. Pick a Boss from their disgusting ranks and make him a 'Big Boss'; maybe then they'll behave?	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_2_2_description	Magic is a tricky thing. A few of the enemy wizards are quite good at it! Fortunately, Mork and Gork can provide: some gobbos and Orcs can fling a good spell too. Find a Goblin Shaman as they're normally cheaper and easier to bully.   	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_3_2_description	While spells of da Little Waaagh! are already at our disposal, it's time to get some of the "bigga spellz" in play. Maybe a foot or fist of Gork to really wind the enemy up? Go and find an Orc Shaman.  	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_4_2_description	The true horror of the Greenskin menace is not always seen on the battlefield but in the devastation left in the wake of the Orc ravagers. They are merciless, and often hungry as they scourge enemy ruins. Be merciless, be more Orc! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_5_2_description	Destroy! We must unleash the beast that lies within every Greenskin. The Orc Gods want this world to tremble, and so our Savage Lord must be "Da Scourge" and burn a scar across the lands that not even time will forget! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_1_3_description	Time to rampage - winning in battle is one thing but a Greenskin's career is all about the lootin' too. Sack and raze enemy settlements - let the foe know that Skarsnik's boyz are coming!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_2_3_description	If their enemies don't fear the Greenskins, then how can they be dominated? They need to dish out some serious damage. Start sacking and looting in the name of Skarsnik!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_3_3_description	More ravaging is needed, our foes still have hope, some even think they can beat us! That needs taking from them - see to it! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_4_3_description	Skarsnik does not have mates, for he does not need them. He tolerates those around him as he rises to greatness. Yet for the Waaagh! to be successful, Skarsnik must give the brutes below him more power, as he cannot do everything himself.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_5_3_description	Grant the most able Warbosses and magic-users in the Greenskin ranks the power and status they need to bring about a slaughter. It is what Gork demands, and Skarsnik knows it is necessary!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_1_1_description	Bring bloodshed and misery to those that stand against the Greenskins. Skarsnik has conspired long and hard to achieve victory, and he will have it by any means necessary. Any means. Gottit, you git? Good.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_2_1_description	Skarsnik is above his boyz, smarter and more cruel. But now is not the time to be a loner - the world needs dominating, and if he wants part of it, he needs to start mobbing-up!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_3_1_description	As much as Skarsnik would revel in outsmarting everyone single-handedly, even he knows he needs the boyz behind him to destroy his foes in short order. The call has gone out, and the mobs are coming.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_4_1_description	The Waaagh! gathers pace! The enemies of the Greenskins - that's everyone without green skin (well, even a few Greenskins to be honest) - will witness a mob like never before. Da Great Ruckus begins! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_5_1_description	An unending tide of green - a mass mob of Orcs and Goblins that would make Gork and Mork swell with pride and send Sigmar and his cronies cowering into the Realm of Chaos! That is the goal, now it's time to bring it! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_1_4_description	Nothing pleases an Orc than being part of a big green mob, mindlessly charging into the enemy. But war is rarely that simple, even the Greenskins know this; sometimes though, somewhat annoyingly, a more strategic approach is needed.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_2_4_description	Skarsnik is eager to unleash his fiendish plots upon unsuspecting enemies, yet there are things that need doing in preparation for the big charge. Get 'em done, and keep Skarsnik happy.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_3_4_description	To bring about the largest Waaagh! this pitiful world has ever seen we need to target that Greenskin aggression. Achieve some key objectives and the green tide will flow!  	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_4_4_description	Skarsnik is smart enough to know that, despite his intellect, he needs the Bosses and Shamans around him to enact his schemes. Give them yet more power so that they may serve him!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_5_4_description	Skarsnik's most feared allies need not only his backing, so they can go about unimpeded, but if they are to spread the word of the Warlord's Waaagh! then they must be granted the power such a message demands!	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_1_5_description	The boyz need loot. Skarsnik needs loot. Every git needs loot! So they better find it; a good few raids should sort out the cash flow.	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_2_5_description	Orcs will travel leagues to join a burgeoning Waaagh!, but they won't come for just any Warboss. They are attracted to those favoured by the Gods, by those whose legends are created by the quests they undertake. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_3_5_description	It ain't cheap keeping all these armies - Orcs are greedy gits that are always after loot and shiny stuff. It might be best to replenish "da cofferz" - a few raids should do the job. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_4_5_description	The best and shiniest stuff… the loot that can make the eyes of the hardiest Warboss water, is rarely in the neighbouring location. The boyz are going to have to loot deep into enemy territory to get the good stuff!   	true
mission_text_text_wh_dlc06_objective_BONUS_skarsnik_5_5_description	Even for Orcs, the lure of shiny stuff is as strong as the thrill of murder - the richest Bosses are always the most successful. If Skarsnik is to bring about Ragnarork then he must become the wealthiest Greenskin as well.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_main_kroq_gar_3_description	Lustria is a land of a Lizardmen past; a ruined civilisation, left to be reclaimed by the jungles.

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_main_kroq_gar_4_description	Kroq-Gar is borne aloft by a centuries-old rage, a fury that was instilled in him by the Great Catastrophe and the coming of Chaos.

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_cylostra_3_description	Cylostra’s grip on the world of the living grows, each battle bringing new ‘fans’ and new territory. Her talent is finally being appreciated, so much so in fact that her fame has even spread as far as Ulthuan once again! As before, the Asur are sure to invite her to perform any day now. If not, Cylostra will just have to invite herself, but not before a good deal more practice!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_cylostra_2_description	Cylostra grows in strength, but needs more practice to fine-tune her upcoming performance for the Asur royalty. More live audiences are required, though they will not survive the show, instead being made to serve their new mistress in death.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_cylostra_1_description	From the depths of the ocean she has returned – not even death can keep Cylostra from a performance for the Phoenix King. Despairing from a prestigious music career cut short, the phantasmal diva first expands her Undead crew, bringing her deathly serenades to the hovels of the living. If they will not listen willingly, her deckhands will ensure they do!	true

mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_cylostra_5_description	Cylostra's voice reverberates across the open sea, carrying a power in her song that no mortal could. There are none who can withstand her song and live; all who hear it are paralysed, leaving them vulnerable to her cutthroat crew. To perform for the Phoenix King was once Cylostra's goal, but such petty aims no longer trouble the prima donna of Shyish. In her ultimate grace, she has vowed to put on performances for ALL mortals, so that they can join her ever-growing group of 'died'-hard fans.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc11_objective_main_cylostra_4_description	As her power grows and her borders expand, Cylostra can wait no longer to perform for the Phoenix King, as she was tasked to all those years ago.

Far from their rightful home, and with little of their former power intact, its Dawi nevertheless cling to hope.

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_1_4_description	To be imprisoned by the armies of the Witch King is a fate nobody would wish upon his worst enemy. Thralls of the Druchii are subjected to back-breaking labour and torture; it is a blessed mercy to be killed early, and swiftly.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_2_4_description	Every slave taken by Malekith strengthens his fight against the High Elves. Each and every man taken provides strength to the Druchii, through manual labour or simply the sport of having them killed.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_3_4_description	The Dark Elves are merciless creatures, but there is certainly a practical use in not killing every captive taken in battle. Whilst scores will be executed, of course, others will be put to work. The labour will kill them eventually, as you might expect.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_4_4_description	The chattels of war progress from the battlefield to serve the Dark Elves' macabre desires.

All of them are marked for death, the only variable being the exact manner of their demise, and how long their bodies will endure before giving in to sweet release...	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_1_5_description	Naggaroth is a cold and desolate range of gnarled mountains and inhospitable climes. It is a perfect reflection of the soul of the Druchii, and Morathi will claim it for them.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_2_5_description	The Dark Elves came to Naggaroth from the ocean, borne by their titanic Black Arks. The sea is familiar to them, and Mathlann provides for those obedient servants.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_3_5_description	To the south of Naggaroth, the climate changes sharply to a dense and humid tropic. The jungles of Lustria are teeming with ruined temples and territorial Lizardmen, but ultimately the Druchii will claim what they desire.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_4_5_description	Lustria could not be any more different from Naggaroth; lush and tropical jungles stand in stark contrast the barren, frigid wastes. Though Lustria is humid and sticky, the Druchii must look covetously upon it all the same.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_5_5_description	It is the will of the Druchii to dominate, it is in their very blood. That they share Naggaroth with insolent barbarians is bad enough, but an entire, lush land to their south, inhabited by pestilent natives? This cannot stand.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_1_1_description	To the Elves, Khaine is the God of War. However, to the Druchii, he more specifically embodies murder, hatred and destruction. When creating rituals, it is to Khaine that the Druchii send their most ardent requests.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_2_1_description	The six-armed goddess Hekarti is the deity of magic and conjuration. She sees the Winds of Magic and bends them to her will. To pray to Hekarti is to desire magical power above all else.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_3_1_description	The God of the Sea, Mathlann, provides grace and safety to those Elves caught on the waves. Much like the tumultuous ocean, however, Mathlann is fickle and capricious; he is just as likely to smash a ship asunder as he is to see it safely to shore.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_4_1_description	Atharti is the Elven Goddess of Seduction and Pleasure, to whom the Druchii are more than happy to offer themselves. To invoke the Lady of Desire is to wholeheartedly pray for the corruption of your enemies; specifically, to break the unflinchingly-uptight hearts of the High Elves.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_5_1_description	The dark invocations of the Druchii are uttered to bring about a single purpose: the destruction of their most hated of foes, the High Elves. The gods of the Elven pantheon are watching, and grant their favour only to the most devout.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_1_2_description	Morathi is a schemer and a plotter. What she does in the shadows maintains the Dark Elves, though few would ever know. Whilst others fight great wars, Morathi stalks the shadows, manipulating the strings of fate between her fingers.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_2_2_description	In the darkness, Morathi thrives. It is said that she has done much and more to keep Malekith alive and in power than even Malekith himself. She holds the Druchii together, when otherwise they would tear themselves apart.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_3_2_description	Morathi has taught Malekith everything she knows over centuries of toil and determination. Her desire to see her son succeed burns obsessively within her. She will unify the Druchii for him, or she will see them destroyed.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_4_2_description	It is said, in hushed whispers, that Morathi would do anything to see Malekith's wishes fulfilled. It is said, in even more hushed whispers, that should her son fall in battle, she would most certainly see the world obliterated as an act of maternal revenge.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_5_2_description	Morathi understands the power of words to get her way. In the shadows, away from the prying eyes, she works tirelessly to maintain her shadowy grip on the Druchii. Malekith should be thankful she is loyal to him, for otherwise she would surely be ascendant.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_1_3_description	There is no shortage of Dark Elves wishing to make a name for themselves; great warriors vying to be powerful and renowned. Those that survive the murderous rat race, then, are truly the mightiest.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_2_3_description	Murder is no stranger to the Druchii; subterfuge and assassination are as much a part of their lives as open battle and bloodshed. Strength is the only determining factor, and nobody can be powerful when they are dead.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_3_3_description	The Tyrants of Naggaroth lead armies into battle through raw strength; no other can lead because no other has the strength. It can be assured, therefore, that an army is in capable hands by the number of Druchii who died vying for that very same role.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_4_3_description	Treachery comes as easily to the Dark Elves as breathing; skulduggery and dark dealings are a means to an end for many power-hungry and conniving Lords, because a well-placed knife in the dark can be more powerful than a thousand arrows on the battlefield...	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_morathi_5_3_description	Many of the greatest Druchii owe a great debt to their familial names. Without them, so many 'great' Dark Elves would be nothing more than lesser nobles, squabbling with others simply to stand near to their superiors.	true

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_1_5_description	When the Phoenix King speaks, the High Elves listen. Tyrion is sworn to carry out the whims of his liege, and see the needs of the High Elves met. To this end, he scours the land in the name of the Phoenix King.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_2_5_description	What the Phoenix King demands, Tyrion answers. He strikes out from coast to coast, encircling Ulthuan a dozen times over in his quest to rid Chaos and corruption from Asur shores. None shall stop him. Indeed, none can.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_3_5_description	There is some deed to be done in every corner of Ulthuan. Since the Sundering, the land has been beset by grim news and growing threats, which must be faced, confronted and solved if Ulthuan is ever to know peace.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_4_5_description	Everything must be for the greater good of Ulthuan; every task, no matter how trivial or seemingly insignificant, will be crucial. When the final history of Ulthuan is written, the epic deeds may be heralded, but the surety of the smaller deeds will never be forgotten.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_5_5_description	Ulthuan must be made pure, must be kept free of all corruption, if the Vortex is to be sustained and the world saved from destruction. To this end, every enemy must be crushed, every foe eradicated, and every whim of the Phoenix King met.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_1_4_description	The Eagle Gate lies in the western mountains of Tiranoc, a land so utterly blighted by the Sundering that it almost vanished entirely. It clings to existence now as a corrupted foothold for Druchii incursions and a grim prophecy of what Ulthuan will become should the High Elves fail to defend it.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_2_4_description	Griffon Gate guards the plains of Ellyrion, a land of vast plains and gentle winds. Its proximity to the blighted Tiranoc, however, means that the Griffon Gate is a crucial point for defending against any Druchii expeditions.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_3_4_description	The Unicorn Gate sits amongst the Annulii Mountains, guarding Ellyrion from the Nagarythe wastes beyond. Any who wish to strike at the heart of Ulthuan must cross the mountains and pass through the gates, where stalwart Asur defenders are waiting.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_4_4_description	The Phoenix Gate carries an auspicious legacy for, much like its eponymous namesake, it has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. Yet that endurance is a source of inspiration for all those who guard it; it represents a hope that, even in darkness, the flames of new life will rise.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_5_4_description	Nagarythe is the homeland of the first Phoenix King and of the Dreadlord, Malekith. That both Asur and Druchii alike lay claim to it makes it one of the most fiercely contested, yet blighted, lands in all of Ulthuan. Even now, the Druchii creep towards its desolate shores...	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_1_3_description	Tyrion is no politician, and would have floundered long ago were it not for the nobility of his birth and the exceptional nature of his talents. Though lacking subtlety and social grace, he proves time and time again that airs of civility are not needed to bring glory to Ulthuan.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_2_3_description	The history of the Asur is the history of great Elves doing great deeds. Whilst scores of armies march to war and Phoenixes and Dragons wheel overhead, it is the great generals - the noble leaders, like Tyrion and Teclis - who drive them to glory time and time again.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_3_3_description	Tyrion is a power beyond reckoning. With the blessing of the Phoenix King, he marches to settle ancient grudges and to restore the lost glory of Ulthuan. None shall stand again him, and all those who do will be destroyed.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_4_3_description	If the Phoenix King is to be successful in dragging Ulthuan from the recesses in which it languishes, he must be sure to have strong and capable leaders to help command his forces. Only strong leadership can ensure a stable Ulthuan.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_5_3_description	From coast to coast, as far abroad as the Lustrian expeditions, they speak of Tyrion's power and might. Truly, they say, there are none amongst him as powerful. Soldiers brag of having fought alongside him, giving praise to the one they call Aenarion reborn.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_1_2_description	They say Tyrion has the ear of the Phoenix King, and is answerable to nobody but him. This favour gives him free range to take the fight to any he deems the enemies of Ulthuan, with unmatched martial prowess.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_2_2_description	Tyrion discharges his duty with a powerful zeal, unlike any others of his ilk. That he is a warrior without peer is undeniable, but all the same he continues to find new ways to scale the heights of power, relentlessly crushing his enemies even in the bleakest of times.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_3_2_description	Enemies sense the relative weakness of Ulthuan and try to seize the Asur lands for themselves. Yet they underestimate the remaining strength of the Asur, who will strike with an ancient rage to defend their home.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_4_2_description	Wars are won not only by the Dragon-riding nobles of Ulthuan, though they would have you believe it. The spear-wielding, bowstring-drawing soldiery are the backbone of High Elf armies, carrying many a force to victory when the blessed Nobles have faltered.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_5_2_description	The forces of Chaos, and those they corrupt, must be fought tooth and nail, to the grim and bitter end. Yet no victory is so sweet as a total destruction. When the tales are written of Chaos' defeat, let them say that it was decisive.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_1_1_description	Prince Tyrion is the greatest living warrior of the High Elves, and stalwart defender of Ulthuan and the Everqueen. He wields armies as elegantly as a politician wields his words, calling the High Elves to his banner in the name of Ulthuan's defence.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_2_1_description	Though Tyrion is a warrior without peer, even he cannot fight the wars of the High Elves alone. From every region of Ulthuan, Tyrion must draw forces to him and, with them at his side, take furious war to his enemies.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_3_1_description	The host of the High Elves is a varied, ancient force. From the towering, ancient Dragons and ethereal and elegant Phoenixes, to the stalwart Elven foot soldiers, the High Elves bring ancient fury to their foes, scouring the world of Chaos.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_4_1_description	The Glittering Host of Ulthuan have waged war against their enemies for thousands and thousands of years. Nobles on Dragon-back reel in the skies above and mysterious, knife-wielding warriors lurk in the shadows beneath. All bring death to their foes, swift and brutal.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_tyrion_5_1_description	The oldest and most terrifyingly powerful of the Ulthuan Dragons are known as Star Dragons. They have seen the turn of the universe, existing longer than even the oldest High Elves can fathom. To have a Star Dragon at your side is to know that Chaos can be defeated.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_dlc09_khatep_3_description	The claws of the Liche Lord delve deeper into the land. No longer a mere itinerant, the exile and his outcast followers have put down roots and must continue to expand. If they can't go to Nehekhara - yet - then the desert shall come to them!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_dlc09_khatep_2_description	Nehekhara beckons. But the time is not right, the return to the Land of the Dead must come with greatness and a vast trove of fresh lore. To that end, Khatep needs to continue his expansion in the chill realms.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_dlc09_khatep_1_description	For centuries Khatep has wandered the world in anguish. His desire is to return to Khemri and be forgiven for the sin of rousing Settra before the Day of Awakening. To make amends, the Liche Lord must gather around him other outcasts of Khemri and forge a powerbase, then answers may be found and, if not outright forgiveness... leniency from the Imperishable.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_dlc09_khatep_5_description	Now, at last, is the time for the Liche Lord to exercise the power he has been building. Now is the time to grow the empire he has founded and show those in Khemri and its surrounding kingdoms that the exiles are ready to return.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_dlc09_objective_dlc09_khatep_4_description	The nascent empire of Undeath, under the stewardship of the Grand Hierophant, thrives. The Mortuary Cult has ever been willing to serve the Tomb Kings, but now their leader wields its power to serve the Cult itself. But such influence is meaningless if their sole, original purpose cannot be fulfilled - to bring about the Day of Awakening.	true

mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_1_4_description	To tarry in Sylvania, and skulk in other dark places that welcome the dead, is short-sighted. If our master is to achieve his destiny then his servants must be sent forth to start pulling - or removing - the levers of power.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_2_4_description	Vlad lies at the centre of a great web of intrigue. From his lair, our master sends word to his puppets of tasks to be done, accounts to be settled and missions to complete.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_3_4_description	As the Undead rise and march forth, the influence of Dark Magic spreads across the lands - fell creatures take roost in once-homely caves, trees become rotten and twisted, and even houses buckle and decay as the corruption spreads.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_4_4_description	Vlad sees his agents as little more than tools, yet some tools are more useful than others. For those lucky few minions, great rewards await - depending on how they serve our master of course.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_5_4_description	The mortals must fear Vlad's Unliving touch - fear that his reach is long and that nowhere is safe from his gnarled talons. To extend such a reach he needs willing servants, with the power and status to influence every area of mortal society.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_1_5_description	As the dead rise, the land itself revolts against the unnatural. We must spread this curse beyond our borders, let the mortals observe and see that death comes for all!	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_2_5_description	Our master has scoured the world for forbidden lore and artefacts of power. It's a search that continues and so word has reached us that another item of great power is within Vlad's grasp.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_3_5_description	Back in the mists of time, when the kings of Nehekhara rose up against Nagash, they were initially repelled by the Great Necromancer's awesome power. Our Lord must echo such victories and repulse all that challenge us!	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_4_5_description	The von Carstein pall of darkness reaches across the nations, infusing the land with Dark Magic. Every place it touches, the dead no longer rest easily in their graves and crypts are broken open from the inside. And so the Undead take the world from the living...	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_5_5_description	For a von Carstein to sit upon a throne of bone as an Immortal Emperor, he must spread his influence far and ensure that his Unliving Empire is ready for its dread sovereign.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_1_2_description	Raising a mortal with the Blood Kiss may sound an easy task, but we do not grant any living fool immortality. Such a gift should not be wasted on serfs - we must choose wisely.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_2_2_description	When the Great Necromancer, Nagash, first dabbled with Dark Magic it seeped into the world and broke it. Now many millennia later, his legacy continues - ravaging the world wherever Necromancy is practised.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_3_2_description	Rise the Undead legions - let them tirelessly march forth just like the armies of the Doomlord of olde!	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_4_2_description	Vlad must maintain political power over his domains. If he is to keep his quarrelling, power-hungry relatives in check then there cannot be any reason for them to question his motives and will. For should a rival Vampire sense weakness, it will strike.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_5_2_description	The machinations of the von Carsteins are complex and despotic. At the height of his power our master must be ready to fend off any plot from a rival ready to strike from the shadows. With immortal glory so close, maintaining his dominion is essential.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_1_3_description	Our Lord's power comes from fear as much from the arcane. We need to ensure that his many enemies fear the von Carstein name and say it only in hushed whispers. Thus is our powerbase maintained and the cattle controlled.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_2_3_description	Vlad may have been the first von Carstein, but he will not be the last. In the last few decades there always seems to be another despicable sire crawling from its crypt, each as power hungry as the other. But it Vlad is the one we serve; we must ensure he remains in power.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_3_3_description	The von Carsteins dominate their homelands because of the terrifying climate they propagate. The few mortals that reside in or close to Sylvania live in constant fear, such is the power of the Midnight Aristocracy…	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_4_3_description	There is a danger by giving a creature as ambitious and predatory as a Vampire too much power. But Vlad knows his kin, knows how they think, knows how to deal with such turn-coats. However, he needs servants that are more than mere pawns, so must grant them a modicum of his power.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_5_3_description	The Eternal Emperor stands ready to take his throne! His most loyal subjects will be rewarded with immortality and other gifts that no mortal could even comprehend; prepare those our master has deemed worthy to enter his scared circle.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_1_1_description	A Vampire strikes from the shadows as well as at the head of skeletal legions. The von Carsteins have always been masters of plots and manipulation; ensure our Lord's goals are achieved by bringing such intrigues to their conclusion.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_2_1_description	The von Carstein bloodline has always excelled at deceit and disguise. Vampires have many guises - a court noble, a renowned wizard, a loyal servant, a baron's spymaster… It is in these roles that they turn fate to their advantage.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_3_1_description	Of the von Carsteins, it was Vlad who was seen as the military genius - taking his Undead hosts to the walls of Altdorf itself. Yet that was then; if this new incursion is to be considered a threat, then our forces need victory in battle.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_4_1_description	The Necromancers have raided the charnel pits and brought us fresh corpses. These should be joined with our legions to create a mighty Undead host worthy of the von Carstein name.	true
mission_text_text_wh_pro02_objective_BONUS_isabella_5_1_description	The Undead are inexhaustible - able to constantly replenish with each new killing. The mortals fear our legions, for they know deep down that, eventually, they will rise up and join them. It is time for our master to field such an army - a legion of Undeath that no foe can challenge!	true

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_chaos_1_1_description	There are many who wish to invoke the attention of the Dark Gods, but the Ruinous Powers will not favour just any mortal; only those who can prove themselves in battle will receive - even then - the barest flicker of acknowledgement. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_chaos_2_1_description	To be the Everchosen, to command thousands? The Chaos Gods will not consider any being who is not a great warrior with an iron will. Archaon must prove his worth through conquest!	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_chaos_3_1_description	All four Marks of Chaos sear Archaon's flesh. But it is Khorne that thirsts and demands the most. Ensure our Lord's forces see battle! 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_chaos_4_1_description	To marshal a host of the Gods' most foul mortal servants is a great challenge, but one Archaon has to grasp, for the rewards are great and failure not worth contemplating. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_chaos_5_1_description	If Archaon commands a grand army, then the Chaos Gods will cast their gaze down onto the Old World and bring ruin upon the lands. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_chaos_1_3_description	A great Chaos Champion, especially the Lord of the End Times, must maintain a reputation of dread. For if he is not feared then why will they follow? 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_chaos_2_3_description	Archaon must maintain his powerbase and support or he will be challenged by unworthy fools who dare to think themselves better than the Three-Eyed King. 	true

mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_chaos_5_3_description	As the End Times draw near, their Lord and catalyst cannot be everywhere at once. Grant his most powerful servants even greater glory so they can bring about the apocalypse.	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_chaos_1_2_description	The path to damnation is long and treacherous, our master will need followers to accompany him as he walks along it.	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_chaos_2_2_description	While we can vanquish the mortals with sword and scourge alone, there are many tools at our Lord's disposal. Recruiting a Chaos Sorcerer is but another. 	true
mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_BONUS_chaos_3_2_description	The more glory the Everchosen achieves, the more jealous his rivals become. They will challenge our master as soon as his dominion falls, so fear and control must be maintained.  	true

mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_1_4_description	Teclis, unlike his brother, believes that the wider world has just as much import as Ulthuan. To this end, he has often struck out into the unexplored, to meet new civilisation and forge new bonds, so that through discussion and alliance, the world might be saved.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_2_4_description	Teclis' travels have taken him far abroad, deeper into uncharted lands than any of the High Elves before him. His mission? To understand those he finds, and to locate strong and suitable partners to help him defeat Chaos.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_3_4_description	The world is wide, and Ulthuan is but a part of it, yet it occupies a unique position at the centre of it all; this prime location makes it an excellent spot for trading, for those who have goods to sell.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_4_4_description	When Teclis marches to battle, he does so knowing that there are strong and dependable allies behind him. So it was in the Great War Against Chaos, when even soldiers from the Empire held fast with Teclis at their side.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_5_4_description	Teclis firmly believes that expansion of ideology, not isolation, is the key to Ulthuan's future. His journeys allow him to share wisdom with those he meets, and create meaningful connections that - he hopes - will make the world a better place.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_1_5_description	The Phoenix King speaks, and the High Elves listen. Teclis is sworn to carry out the whims of his king, and see the needs of the High Elves met. To this end, he scours the land in his liege's name.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_2_5_description	What the Phoenix King demands, Teclis delivers. He strikes out from coast to coast, encircling Ulthuan a dozen times over in his quest to rid Chaos and corruption from Asur shores. None shall stop him. Indeed, none can.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_3_5_description	There is some deed to be done in every corner of Ulthuan. Since the Sundering, the land has been beset by grim news and growing threats, which must be faced, confronted and solved if Ulthuan is ever to know peace.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_4_5_description	Everything must be for the greater good of Ulthuan; every task, no matter how trivial or seemingly insignificant, will be crucial. When the final history of Ulthuan is written, the epic deeds may be heralded, but the surety of the smaller deeds will never be forgotten.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_5_5_description	Ulthuan must be made pure, must be kept free of all corruption, if the Vortex is to be sustained and the world saved from destruction. To this end, every enemy must be crushed, every foe eradicated, and every whim of the Phoenix King met.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_1_2_description	Hoeth is the Asur deity of wisdom and a patron of all those seeking greater knowledge. To pray to Hoeth when preparing a ritual is to ask for understanding.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_2_2_description	Vaul is the Elven patron of armour and blacksmithing. He was blinded during a battle with Khaine, who then enslaved the armourer. Vaul is a symbol of power to the Elves, and any invocation of his name is an attempt to channel that strength.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_3_2_description	Asuryan is the masked ruler of the Elven pantheon; masked because his face has never been seen. He is chief justice of the Elves, and invoking him is to request the greatest of powers.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_4_2_description	Isha is the Elven Goddess of Fertility, and protector of the natural order. Invoking her is a request to preserve and maintain that which is - such as the Vortex - and save the world from an inexorable slide into destruction.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_5_2_description	It is only through constant ritual and invocation that the High Elves maintain the world as it is. At the centre of Ulthuan, the Isle of the Dead hosts the Great Vortex, held in place by the channelled powers of dozens of High Elven Mages, sustained forever in their work.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_1_3_description	This is an age of destruction and desperation, where the people cry out for warriors of renown to defend them. Ulthuan must have those warriors, that would fight with Teclis in defence of Ulthuan, and the world!	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_2_3_description	Teclis believes in the overbearing power of magic - and so he should, for it sustains his otherwise broken physical form. So powerful is Teclis, that it is said he could be greater perhaps than even the Necromancer, Nagash.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_3_3_description	Teclis believes that through greater unity and understanding, and no small measure of force, Chaos will be relegated to oblivion and the enemies of Ulthuan will be destroyed. He is willing to learn from anyone who wishes to aid the High Elves in that endeavour.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_4_3_description	If the Phoenix King is to be successful in dragging Ulthuan from the recesses in which it languishes, he must be sure to have strong and capable leaders to help lead his forces. Only strong leadership can ensure a stable Ulthuan.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_5_3_description	It is said that, since the Battle of Finuval Plains, Malekith himself takes great pains to avoid confrontation with his younger cousin, Teclis. For such is Teclis' gift for magic that even the Witch King considers him superior.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_1_1_description	What Teclis lacks in physical prowess, he more than makes up for in intellect. Where Tyrion sees Ulthuan defended at the tip of a spear, Teclis sees the world sustained under magic and ideology. Thus, he endeavours to see his vision realised.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_2_1_description	Teclis is responsible for furthering the learning and understanding of magic, not only in Ulthuan but throughout the world. To that end, he allied himself with Magnus the Pious, which in turn led to the establishment of the College of Magic, far away in the Empire.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_3_1_description	What Teclis does not already know, he will soon discover. His journeys outside of Ulthuan are fact-finding missions, and through his voyages he gains greater understanding of the world, and greater power with which to aid it.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_4_1_description	Understanding is key, or so Teclis believes. Understanding unlocks greater strength, which gives the High Elves the power to defeat their enemies and, beyond that, ensure the stability of the very world itself.	true
mission_text_text_wh2_main_objective_BONUS_teclis_5_1_description	To believe that Teclis is the weaker of the two brothers would be a grave error. Tyrion certainly does not believe that to be so, and nor do Ulthuan's enemies. The power and knowledge contained within Teclis is something unseen for generations; a dark portent for all his enemies.	true
