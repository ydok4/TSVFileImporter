Franz knows this is a test of his sovereignty, that the unconvinced Electors will be watching and even hoping he fails. So he must face the Norsemen and be victorious. They will come in waves, like the very sea itself!  	true

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_main_qb_lzd_kroqgar_hand_of_gods_stage_3_fallen_gates	With Kroq-Gar’s legions hissing, fierce and ready, it is time to march on the Fallen Gates. The Elf servants have blasphemed not just by leaving Ulthuan, but by daring to interfere with the Cosmic Gates - an ancient device that can open a portal into the Realm of Chaos. For such a heinous transgression, the Elves must be punished as decreed by the Lord of Solar-City. The gates are surrounded by a deep crevasse that must be crossed before the Asur are truly engaged. The trespassers will try to stop Kroq-Gar, but that is their mistake to make!	true

Should he be victorious he will be etched into the bloody history of the Empire! 	true
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_qb_cst_aranessa_saltspite_krakens_bane	What started out as a hunt to punish some Norscans for murdering Manann's creatures has now become an emotionally-charged family affair. Aranessa may have been born Norscan, but her allegiance has always been to the sea. Rejected and betrayed by her own flesh and blood as a baby, she now has a chance to appease the bitterness raging eternally inside her.

The Skjold chieftain claiming to be her birth father has just launched a raid against Pack Ice Bay. Aranessa vows that no more innocent creatures of the sea shall die in her name – this ends now!	true

The Shadow King must use all of Loec's tricks to evade capture and make the Dark Elves pay for this brazen and doomed act. Like the shadows the king and his warriors are named after, the Asur must remain evasive and not get pinned down, for that is when the Dark Elves might actually get the upper hand.	true

Along the Cliff of Beasts, our scouts return with news that the forces of Ruin have decided to meet us in battle. Led by Archaon the Everchosen, and accompanied by the Prince of Slaneesh, Sigvald the Magnificent, the Chaos army seem ready to offer us a fight for the ages! The skies above, ever ominous during our perilous journey, turn now even more despondent. Thunder rolls across the grizzly clouds, and in the distance, lightning arcs through the deepening sky. The air hisses with static; could this be the moment of our destiny?	true

The throng will not be moved until the cull has happened. The Dawi will stand firm as wave after wave of monsters are drawn to what they think is prey. It will be a long haul, but the purge must happen! 	true
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc05_qb_wef_orion_the_spear_of_kurnous_stage_3_the_oak_of_ages_mini	These violent desires must not come to fruition. Orion is all that stands between the Oak of Ages and the utter ruin of Athel Loren. They will come from the south, intent on breaking through Orion's defences and attacking the Oak, but the king will stand firm. Indeed he must, for the alternative is the destruction of the forest as he knows it. Yet Anath Raema is determined, she will see the rebel band is reinforced with her minions where possible. Orion and his forces must be ever-vigilant, although with all of Athel Loren behind him and the power of Ariel within his soul he cannot fail. He will not fail! He will see these dark desires meet a violent end and peace return to Athel Loren's gentle glades.	true

The false prophet has stopped hiding like a coward, and is forced to face Wurrzag. The Goblin has taken position on a hill, where he’ll be difficult to shift. But just before Wurrzag commits to battle, he falls into a trance - Gork is talking to him. The Great Green God warns his Shaman that the sneaky Gobbo is laying a trap and more of his mates are skulking close by. Gits!	true

If the glades are to be restored to their former sanctity, this scourge must be expunged. Yet the Eldest of Ancients must take care; more Undead will filter onto the field as the Necromancer takes hold of more cadavers. Durthu must strike fast and cut the head from this serpent. The Necromancer himself must fall, for it is he who controls these shuffling thralls. Once he is gone, they will soon lose their sense of purpose. One fell strike with all the strength of the Ancients behind him and Durthu will see this blight excised and the forests restored!	true

As he approaches the island, however, it appears his map is not the only one in existence – a large army of treasure-hunting soldiers of fortune has somehow found its way there ahead of him and pitched camp at the top of a hill. Before the day is out, Noctilus will surely have made yet more of the dead to raise into his Undead ranks!	true

Their force still poses great danger, however, if it is not defeated here.

The effects of the potion yet linger upon the beleaguered enemy, however, which gives the Bretonnians an edge.

The trail of breadcrumbs… the false litany... the lure of redemption - it is all an elaborate deception, fiendishly wrought to tantalise him, to draw him to this place and to his destruction. As the pieces fall into place in Khatep’s mind, his outrage is consumed in the white heat of fury. The foul apostates will pay with their souls – as will their beast-kin thralls!	true

Tyrion finds himself accused of Dark Elf sympathies by the Loremasters - it matters little that this situation has been brought about by the intrigues of selfish princes jealous of Tyrion’s influence over the Phoenix King.

Indeed he must, for the alternative is the destruction of the forest as he knows it. Yet Anath Raema is determined, she will see the rebel band is reinforced with her minions where possible. Orion and his forces must be ever-vigilant, although with all of Athel Loren behind him and the power of Ariel within his soul he cannot fail. He will not fail!

The Followers of Nagash raise their warriors even as the Black Pyramid climbs into the sky. The battle for its control is about to begin.	true

The Elf servants have blasphemed not just by leaving Ulthuan, but by daring to interfere with the Cosmic Gates - an ancient device that can open a portal into the Realm of Chaos. For such a heinous transgression, the Elves must be punished as decreed by the Lord of Solar-City. The gates are surrounded by a deep crevasse that must be crossed before the Asur are truly engaged. The trespassers will try to stop Kroq-Gar, but that is their mistake to make!	true
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_final_battle_settra	The five books are found. The Liche Priests begin the ultimate incantation, igniting the power within the stirring Black Pyramid. Nagash’s ultimate legacy is ripe for domination.

Good! Such dark emotions will further empower Skarsnik's new prodder, making the artefact even more spiteful. First, though, he must be victorious.

He knows precisely where the gold is, and now it is his for the taking - anything that gets in his way will be swiftly dealt with, for death comes to all who oppose the Pirate King!	true

It was a dangerous task, but one the proud Dwarfs of that Hold willingly volunteered for. However, now the White Dwarf must come to their aid or risk dishonour!

As Gotrek previously warned, this Greenskin horde is full of monsters -a fetish of the Warboss, but one that the Dawi will easily overcome. Thundering Falls makes for a perfect trap through which to take on such creatures, which is why it was chosen, but hopefully the Warboss was not canny enough to keep back any monstrous reserves!	true

You are merely interlopers, for the sea-beast allies itself to the High Elves, who are the mortal enemies of your stalker. Now your use is at an end, he will take the harpoon, kill the beast and revel in the infamy.

As the Greenskin hordes prepare to charge each other Gashtooth produces the Squiggly Beast. In a taunting gesture he shows Wurrzag’s pet a glowing mushroom.

Between them is an open field offering little cover. Beyond that Alberic must face the steeled, readied mercenary Knights. He must also beware of the guns used by these brigands – they would rather shoot from afar than fight with honour and courage.

Not only is it the scene of many a battle, its mountainsides are riddled with ancient Dwarf Halls and lost dungeons. These catacombs are prime quest territory for parties of adventurers searching for riches and lost heirlooms. One such party has emerged into the gloomy daylight to see Wurrzag’s army gathering in the pass. To take Wurrzag’s head as a prize, to deliver it before the Imperial throne, would be a great bounty. And so the heroes decide to attack, but they are not foolish enough to believe they can fight this hoard alone, they fight with a rapidly-approaching Empire army at their backs!	true

Whilst they can hold on for now, he must move swiftly to aid them or they will be completely overrun by the Undead menace. The Ashenhall is a craggy, obstacle-laden place, with many natural points of defence - the terrain is advantageous to he who holds it.

Her retinue lies across from Orion, but there will doubtless be more coming to her aid. This aid will not take the form of Elves, however, as the Ruinous Powers seek to secure their fleeting foothold on this realm. Dark and corrupted forces will try to stop Orion in his endeavour, but he must hold firm against them all and recover the relic before it is snatched away beyond his reach.	true

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_qb_nor_monster_hunt_9	After endless days trudging through the jungle, your warband arrives at a great temple scattered with the bones of beasts and other prey. It is a feeding ground. You turn to ask the Skink if this is the place to bait a trap, but the reptile has gone! All that remains is a shackle containing a foot gnawed through at the ankle. It seems the trap is not yours to set - for you are the bait!

A great roar rumbles across the clearing, the ground shakes, birds scatter from the lush canopies, and the usually-loud jungle is suddenly silent... until pierced by another roar. Then, from the trees, a chanting is heard "Gargantulzan! Gargantulzan! Gargantulzan!"

The behemoth has arrived, and you must now fight a Carnosaur of legend!	true

And so the Elves descend upon them with pride and vengeance in their hearts. However, they are deep within enemy territory now and do not know from which direction further Beastmen may come to aid their brothers and forestall Elven vengeance. And so Orion must be swift, he must be strong and above all he must be furious; let the rage of the ancient forest of Athel Loren rain destruction upon these calamitous fiends, that they never darken the forest again.	true

If the enemy general, the Ar-Ulric's loyal servant, be slain then an uneasy peace should quickly follow between the two sides. By the same token, it is clear that the Ar-Ulric wishes the Grand Theogonist dead, thinking his replacement would be more amenable to Ulrican concerns... perhaps.
