His own Black Tower seems to be the destination.\n\nArkhan's concern soon grows to mounting horror as he watches rank after rank of Skaven warriors marching into view. He spies ragged banners proclaiming the armies of three - no, four! Four clans are present - A veritable Vermintide! The foremost warlord holds aloft the Staff of Nagash and laughs at the top of its wet lungs. A subterfuge, then... this is Settra's doing! He has gifted the staff to the faithless ratmen in return for Arkhan's destruction - and on his own turf. Betrayed, Arkhan's horror turns to dark rage and steely determination. This will be a fight to remember... if he can survive the Skaven onslaught!

To bind such a soul into his Tomb Blade, the Liche King reasons, would amplify its power magnificently. But to perform such a rite, Alcadizaar's remains will be required.

After much deliberation, they propose a ritual to invoke the Asp-Goddess and awaken her blessing once more. The incantations cannot be performed without due honours, however.

Enraged, Khalida bellows in fury and shatters the artefact, then curtly orders her priestesses to prepare a rite of purification. As their intonations fill the caverns, the corrupted waters turn pure again, and serpents emerge from crevices to form a writhing carpet. Khalida hears the voice of Asaph, stronger now "The beauty of my shrines is restored, but vengeance is yet unanswered. You will find our enemies on the river turned to ash. Destroy them in my name!"

The divine venom in Khalida’s veins flows sluggishly, and her Venom Staff seems devoid of the goddess' fury. Deeply concerned by this, she summons her priestesses for counsel. After much deliberation, they propose a ritual to invoke the Asp-Goddess and awaken her blessing once more. The incantations cannot be performed without due honours, however. To provide a fitting stage for the ceremony, the Temple of Asaph must be restored to its former glory.

Thousands of snake-bones litter the cave floor and the springwater is befouled by necromancy. The source of the corruption, a black orb, lies upon the altar of Asaph.

A way to renew Settra - and others besides - to true life? Surely this would restore Khatep's honour and station! Divining an appropriate site for the liturgy will require a powerful expenditure of energy - a Nehekharan Rite should suffice.

The Sea-God must be in great distress, for the power he gifts Aranessa through Krakens' Bane to be wavering so. The Queen of Tides has sensed the sea is unsettled, that a storm is brewing of such scale that Aranessa herself may struggle to traverse it unscathed. Manann is clearly in pain, and only she can aid the deity and restore power to Krakens' Bane, so she must find the source of this pain and heal it before the seas become a maelstrom. Her first stop is Sartosa, where someone is bound to have some information about the sea’s growing unrest...

false	wh2_dlc11_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_2	Sartosa is a haven for pirates, smugglers, and seafaring lowlifes. Sure enough, one of its denizens spotted something while out on a recent journey on the open seas - a band of Norscan raiders was sighted slaughtering sea creatures. The rumours are that they have declared war upon Manann himself in the name of their Chaos Gods. In response, Aranessa immediately calls on her crew to set sail for Norsca, barking out her orders with bitter, hate-filled words, for only Norscans can draw such ire from their captain. The living members of her crew make the sign of Manann, quietly reciting prayers in anticipation of the fight to come, for Saltspite has already decided the fate of the Northmen responsible for these crimes against the sea, and along with her deckhands she will ensure that they pay for their villainy!

false	wh2_dlc11_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_3	As the final Norscan battle cries are snuffed out, the crew of the Swordfysh call out to their captain to announce that a ship with Empire markings is approaching. Aranessa, known for never letting her guard down, has fired on the Empire before, when they’d approached her unannounced, so they must have important business to risk such a manoeuvre. She allows the ship to approach peacefully, and the commanding officer of the vessel announces himself as an Empire captain by the name of Kolt Ludenhof. He is offering Saltspite a deal – the Empire wish to quell the recent Norscan menace by any means necessary to secure their ocean trading routes. Should Aranessa aid him in this task, she is assured of a generous reward. Aranessa contemplates the offer – she will suffer an alliance with the Empire just as long as there's worthwhile profit to be made.\n\nWith the deal agreed, Ludenhof requests Saltspite head to Norsca to gather more information on what the Norscans are up to. As a down-payment for this task, Aranessa is presented with an incredible gem the size of a fist. Her permanent scowl breaks for a moment and a smile shines across her face with the glow of a new dawn, for her love of jewels is well known. Her scowl quickly returns, however, for now a hunt is about to begin. To Norsca!	Krakens' Bane	RAID_SUB_CULTURE	rom_event_mission.png	cst/generic	true	Quest		0	0	false	0	2040920400	false	false
false	wh2_dlc11_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_4	After burning several Norscan villages to the ground, Aranessa finds the information she seeks. The raiding parties originated from the Norscan coastal town of Skjold, whose marauders have been targeting islands in the neighbouring seas, slaughtering all marine creatures they encountered and offering them as sacrifices to their Dark Gods. A rage stirs within Aranessa and her heart weeps; such murderous acts against Manann's children cannot be tolerated! Long ago, the Sea-God took her in, raising her as his own daughter through a trio of Sea Nymphs living on one of those very isles.\n\nThe source of the raids must be found, so Aranessa may avenge the slain. With Skjold her next destination, she sends a messenger informing Captain Ludenhof what she has discovered before setting sail.

false	wh2_dlc11_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_5	While on the approach to Skjold, the Swordfysh encountered a small vessel of Marauders that Aranessa’s crew managed to overpower and capture. Before being forced to walk the plank into Promethean-infested waters, one of the captives reveals to Aranessa why the Skjold raiders targeted Manann’s children so relentlessly, alleging that when the chieftain of Skjold heard of the Queen of Tides, he flew into a fit of rage, claiming that she must be his daughter who he’d thought dead and lost. The truth is that he threw Aranessa into the ocean as a baby, believing she would attract the ire of the Dark Gods he was so desperate to impress. She was born bearing the mutations of the sea, which are considered to be a curse sent to draw the ire of the Ruinous Powers. For many Norscans, to accept the gifts of one God is to shun those of another, and so some mutations are punishable by death lest the Dark Gods become jealous. \n\nThe Skjold chieftain mobilised his fleet as soon as he learned that Aranessa was still alive, believing that by murdering as many sea creatures as possible he could prove beyond doubt his rejection of Aranessa before his Gods. She is no longer a baby to be thrown away, however – she is the Queen of Tides, favoured by Manann, who will ensure the Sea-God has his revenge. Saltspite can wait no longer for the Empire’s help - she pledges to slay the pathetic wretch claiming to be her birth-father by her own hand!

false	wh2_dlc11_cst_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_1	Luthor Harkon has been looking for a way to restore his connection to the Winds of Magic for decades. Many years ago he disturbed an ancient chamber sealed with some powerful glyphs, which retaliated by draining away his powers. In addition to losing his spellcasting abilities, his mind was shattered into a dozen different facets which left him teetering on the brink of insanity.\n\nWell aware of his mental instabilities, Luthor realises he can no longer risk losing control at a crucial moment, for if a weaker personality were to take over during a fight it could mean the difference between victory and defeat. At the very worst, such a situation could be his very undoing. He decides he needs a capable first mate to take command of his Undead crewmen should he falter at an inconvenient time.

false	wh2_dlc11_cst_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_2	With control over his Undead crew better asserted, Luthor decides to step up his efforts to repair his damaged psyche. He does not know for sure, but thinks it likely that the glyphs which drained his powers and shattered his mind all those years ago were of Slann origin. In a moment of manic realisation, Luthor concludes that the best chance he has to undo his impairments is to find powerful artefacts from the same source.\n\nThe Slann – a powerful species of Lizardmen with an unparalleled mastery over the Sorcerous arts – are known to use many enchanted totems and trinkets of gold to serve their indecipherable purposes. The best chance of finding one is to search the most ancient ruins of the long-abandoned cities and towns of Lustria and beyond, where the Slann are most likely to have left their mark. It may be a long shot, but one that Luthor is desperate enough to take.	Quest for Slann Gold	SEARCH_RUINS	rom_event_mission.png	cst/generic	false	Quest		0	0	true	0	716276183	false	false
false	wh2_dlc11_cst_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_3	Having ordered his Undead crewmen to leave no stone unturned, it seems that the ruins do not contain the artefacts Luthor seeks. His Zombie Deckhands manage to capture a small, reptile-like creature hiding amongst the rubble, which they drag hissing and writhing before him. Gathering himself for a moment, Luthor recognises it as a Skink – a smaller species of Lizardman, typically more mentally agile than others in their cold-blooded ranks. Surely this peon knows how to get his hands on what Luthor seeks?\n\nHe demands that the location of any nearby enchanted Slann Gold be revealed, but is brazenly ignored. This lizard-minion obviously does not know who it is dealing with – patience and rationality are not qualities present in any of his fractured personalities. In an instant, Luthor is pressing his pistol against the Skink’s head, muttering lunacies and cocking the hammer. The startled prisoner immediately starts blurts out something about a chest of glyph-embossed medallions buried underneath the very ruins in which they stand. The Skink claims they had previously belonged to the great Mage-Priest Mazdamundi himself, but had been stolen by one of several expeditions that had recently passed through the region.\n\nLuthor turns away to ponder, leaving the Lizardman to his starved Scurvy Dogs. The chest of Slann Gold could be anywhere by now, and finding it will not be simple. Luthor flies into a sudden rage, growling to his crew to prepare for a long campaign of despoilment. He will sack cities near and far in his search, caring not for the wars he might start!

false	wh2_dlc11_cst_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_4	After looting countless settlements and torturing thousands of unfortunate victims, Luthor and his pirate horde come across a shackled slave who claims to have been a former soldier of the Empire. He tells Luthor that he had recently been part of an expeditionary force that found a chest of embossed Slann Gold, but on their way back to camp they were ambushed by a vast Lizardmen army, the largest he had ever seen. The soldier narrowly escaped with his life, but everyone in his troop was slaughtered and the Lizardmen made off back to Lustria with their gold.\n\nClearly this hoard is of great importance to the Lizardmen for them to have brought such a force to take it back – there must be more to this gold than its monetary value alone. Luthor can see his goal clearly now, his mind yearning to be repaired. He needs to gather his minions, return to Lustria, and attack these cold-blooded freaks!

false	wh2_dlc11_cst_noctilus_captain_roths_moondial_stage_1	Count Noctilus is well aware of the raw power he can draw from the Galleon’s Graveyard. Having translocated himself and his castle there many years ago, it is a place close to his cold, dead heart, a place where he is able to exert an incredible level of Necromantic control over both the dead and inanimate objects. Indeed, it was in the Galleon’s Graveyard that he forged his floating castle known as the Bloody Reaver from the wreckage of sunken war galleons and set out to dominate the Great Ocean. To help his deathly enterprise, more powerful minions will need to be added to the Undead backbone of Noctilus’ pirate empire. The Maelstrom – the skull-strewn vortex located at the centre of the Galleon’s Graveyard, drawing the dead unto itself like a giant lodestone – must be stoked into a more active state before he can raise them.

One of the most morbid creations the Maelstrom can help to manifest is the Necrofex Colossus – a twisted amalgam of dead bodies fused with the timber and iron of sunken ships to create a monstrous humanoid giant. To wield such unholy power is to be feared in any battle, whether on land or at sea. Noctilus’ rise to power is nigh!

false	wh2_dlc11_cst_noctilus_captain_roths_moondial_stage_3	Having put together a crew of unspeakable horrors, this is undoubtedly the time for Count Noctilus to act. But first, to ensure his supremacy over the seas stays unsurpassed, he must ensure that the Galleon’s Graveyard remains out of the reach of rival Necromancers also hoping to harness the boundless power emanating from the Maelstrom. Very few are able to find it without possessing very specific navigational knowledge, but one particular enchanted instrument makes it possible for even a novice to do so – Captain Roth’s Moondial. Captain Roth is a famous seafarer and native of Sartosa, known for being Noctilus’ one-time arch-rival. After one of Noctilus’ midnight raids led to the demise of Roth’s entire family, the anguished captain led a fleet directly to the Galleon’s Graveyard to avenge them, a navigational feat only made possible with his magical moondial. Neither Noctilus or Roth were defeated outright in the immense sea battle that ensued that day, but both suffered extensive casualties. The horrors Roth’s crew witnessed in the Galleon’s Graveyard pushed many of them to desertion following the battle. During the confusion, his moondial was opportunistically stolen, ensuring that the graveyard could never be easily found again.\nAs long as Captain Roth’s Moondial might still be out there, however, Noctilus’ dominance over the seas will always be under threat. The Count senses that other Necromancers must be searching for the moondial, intending to find the Galleon’s Graveyard and use the Maelstrom themselves. There’s no time to waste – he must now begin a campaign of raiding to find it himself, and with any luck he'll uncover the device before they do.

Finally, following a boarding action against an Empire trading vessel daring to cross the Great Ocean, a clue is found – a map, supposedly leading to a treasure chest in which the moondial was last seen.\nNoctilus examines the map closely. He feels like he is looking at one of his own traps, but nothing is going to get in his way. The map might lead him to the moondial, or perhaps to someone who knows where it is. In any case, Noctilus will crush anyone who opposes him!

false	wh2_dlc11_cst_vortex_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_1	Luthor Harkon has been looking for a way to restore his connection to the Winds of Magic for decades. Many years ago he disturbed an ancient chamber sealed with some powerful glyphs, which retaliated by draining away his powers. In addition to losing his spellcasting abilities, his mind was shattered into a dozen different facets which left him teetering on the brink of insanity.\n\nWell aware of his mental instabilities, Luthor realises he can no longer risk losing control at a crucial moment, for if a weaker personality were to take over during a fight it could mean the difference between victory and defeat. At the very worst, such a situation could be his very undoing. He decides he needs a capable first mate to take command of his Undead crewmen should he falter at an inconvenient time.

He does not know for sure, but thinks it likely that the glyphs which drained his powers and shattered his mind all those years ago were of Slann origin. In a moment of manic realisation, Luthor concludes that the best chance he has to undo his impairments is to find powerful artefacts from the same source.\n\nThe Slann – a powerful species of Lizardmen with an unparalleled mastery over the Sorcerous arts – are known to use many enchanted totems and trinkets of gold to serve their indecipherable purposes. The best chance of finding one is to search the most ancient ruins of the long-abandoned cities and towns of Lustria and beyond, where the Slann are most likely to have left their mark. It may be a long shot, but one that Luthor is desperate enough to take.	Quest for Slann Gold	SEARCH_RUINS	rom_event_mission.png	cst/generic	false	Quest		0	0	true	0	2140784718	false	false

Gathering himself for a moment, Luthor recognises it as a Skink – a smaller species of Lizardman, typically more mentally agile than others in their cold-blooded ranks. Surely this peon knows how to get his hands on what Luthor seeks?\n\nHe demands that the location of any nearby enchanted Slann Gold be revealed, but is brazenly ignored. This lizard-minion obviously does not know who it is dealing with – patience and rationality are not qualities present in any of his fractured personalities. In an instant, Luthor is pressing his pistol against the Skink’s head, muttering lunacies and cocking the hammer. The startled prisoner immediately starts blurts out something about a chest of glyph-embossed medallions buried underneath the very ruins in which they stand. The Skink claims they had previously belonged to the great Mage-Priest Mazdamundi himself, but had been stolen by one of several expeditions that had recently passed through the region.\n\nLuthor turns away to ponder, leaving the Lizardman to his starved Scurvy Dogs. The chest of Slann Gold could be anywhere by now, and finding it will not be simple. Luthor flies into a sudden rage, growling to his crew to prepare for a long campaign of despoilment. He will sack cities near and far in his search, caring not for the wars he might start!

He tells Luthor that he had recently been part of an expeditionary force that found a chest of embossed Slann Gold, but on their way back to camp they were ambushed by a vast Lizardmen army, the largest he had ever seen. The soldier narrowly escaped with his life, but everyone in his troop was slaughtered and the Lizardmen made off back to Lustria with their gold.\n\nClearly this hoard is of great importance to the Lizardmen for them to have brought such a force to take it back – there must be more to this gold than its monetary value alone. Luthor can see his goal clearly now, his mind yearning to be repaired. He needs to gather his minions, return to Lustria, and attack these cold-blooded freaks!

Having translocated himself and his castle there many years ago, it is a place close to his cold, dead heart, a place where he is able to exert an incredible level of Necromantic control over both the dead and inanimate objects. Indeed, it was in the Galleon’s Graveyard that he forged his floating castle known as the Bloody Reaver from the wreckage of sunken war galleons and set out to dominate the Great Ocean. To help his deathly enterprise, more powerful minions will need to be added to the Undead backbone of Noctilus’ pirate empire. The Maelstrom – the skull-strewn vortex located at the centre of the Galleon’s Graveyard, drawing the dead unto itself like a giant lodestone – must be stoked into a more active state before he can raise them.

But first, to ensure his supremacy over the seas stays unsurpassed, he must ensure that the Galleon’s Graveyard remains out of the reach of rival Necromancers also hoping to harness the boundless power emanating from the Maelstrom. Very few are able to find it without possessing very specific navigational knowledge, but one particular enchanted instrument makes it possible for even a novice to do so – Captain Roth’s Moondial. Captain Roth is a famous seafarer and native of Sartosa, known for being Noctilus’ one-time arch-rival. After one of Noctilus’ midnight raids led to the demise of Roth’s entire family, the anguished captain led a fleet directly to the Galleon’s Graveyard to avenge them, a navigational feat only made possible with his magical moondial. Neither Noctilus or Roth were defeated outright in the immense sea battle that ensued that day, but both suffered extensive casualties. The horrors Roth’s crew witnessed in the Galleon’s Graveyard pushed many of them to desertion following the battle. During the confusion, his moondial was opportunistically stolen, ensuring that the graveyard could never be easily found again.\nAs long as Captain Roth’s Moondial might still be out there, however, Noctilus’ dominance over the seas will always be under threat. The Count senses that other Necromancers must be searching for the moondial, intending to find the Galleon’s Graveyard and use the Maelstrom themselves. There’s no time to waste – he must now begin a campaign of raiding to find it himself, and with any luck he'll uncover the device before they do.

He feels like he is looking at one of his own traps, but nothing is going to get in his way. The map might lead him to the moondial, or perhaps to someone who knows where it is.

Many years ago, when the Lamprey succumbed to a storm in the Eastern Straits of the Great Ocean, before Cylostra’s transformation, she was on an important diplomatic voyage to sing before the Phoenix King. A treaty of great import was reliant on his pleasure in her performance, for the Elves believe good art – music in particular – to be as valuable as gems and gold. It was an important engagement, so surely the High Elves will still be waiting for her? Cylostra decided to head towards the southern end of the Shifting Isles, where the High Elves' Old World shipping lanes are located, following them directly into the great Elven port of Lothern and, hopefully, to the Phoenix King himself... \n\nCylostra orders the Lamprey through the Shifting Isles – the ones that are currently visible, at least – ordering her lookouts to keep their rotting eyeballs peeled. At first it seems there's no High Elf naval presence anywhere to be seen - whether the Asur are under the magical protection of the ancient spells shrouding the area, or are simply eluding her by other means, Cylostra does not know. Suddenly, she spots a ship moored off one of the islands, where large numbers of troops are disembarking. And what's this? Could it be the standard of the Phoenix King she sees?

The truth is that he threw Aranessa into the ocean as a baby, believing she would attract the ire of the Dark Gods he was so desperate to impress. She was born bearing the mutations of the sea, which are considered to be a curse sent to draw the ire of the Ruinous Powers. For many Norscans, to accept the gifts of one God is to shun those of another, and so some mutations are punishable by death lest the Dark Gods become jealous. \n\nThe Skjold chieftain mobilised his fleet as soon as he learned that Aranessa was still alive, believing that by murdering as many sea creatures as possible he could prove beyond doubt his rejection of Aranessa before his Gods. She is no longer a baby to be thrown away, however – she is the Queen of Tides, favoured by Manann, who will ensure the Sea-God has his revenge.

For this vainglorious diva, the world is not enough – Cylostra has set her heart on stardom and becoming a household name again.

If Cylostra can somehow find the merchant ship routes used by the High Elves to get to and from the Old World, the way to Lothern and the Phoenix King can be ascertained.

Many years ago, when the Lamprey succumbed to a storm in the Eastern Straits of the Great Ocean, before Cylostra’s transformation, she was on an important diplomatic voyage to sing before the Phoenix King. A treaty of great import was reliant on his pleasure in her performance, for the Elves believe good art – music in particular – to be as valuable as gems and gold. It was an important engagement, so surely the High Elves will still be waiting for her? Cylostra decided to head towards the southern end of the Shifting Isles, where the High Elves' Old World shipping lanes are located, following them directly into the great Elven port of Lothern and, hopefully, to the Phoenix King himself... \n\nCylostra orders the Lamprey through the Shifting Isles – the ones that are currently visible, at least – ordering her lookouts to keep their rotting eyeballs peeled. At first it seems there's no High Elf naval presence anywhere to be seen - whether the Asur are under the magical protection of the ancient spells shrouding the area, or are simply eluding her by other means, Cylostra does not know. Suddenly, she spots a ship moored off one of the islands, where large numbers of troops are disembarking. And what's this? Could it be the standard of the Phoenix King she sees? From the look of the ship, it certainly belongs to the High Elf fleet at the very least. There's not time to waste - only time to get ready for the show!

The rumours were that a band of Norscan raiders had declared war upon Manann himself in the name of their Chaos Gods, slaughtering innocent creatures of the sea, so Aranessa immediately called upon her crew to set sail for Norsca, swearing that they would pay for their villainy! \n\nAfter burning several Norscan villages to the ground, Aranessa found the information she sought, with the help of an Empire captain named Kolt Ludenhof. The raiding parties had originated from the Norscan coastal town of Skjold, whose marauders were targeting islands in the neighbouring seas, slaughtering all marine creatures they encountered and offering them as sacrifices to their Dark Gods. They were under orders from their chieftain, who claimed that the Queen of Tides must be his daughter, who he’d thought dead and lost. The truth is that he threw Aranessa into the ocean as a baby, believing she would attract the ire of the Dark Gods due to the mutations of the sea she bore, which among the Norscans are considered to be a curse. The Skjold chieftain mobilised his fleet as soon as he learned that Aranessa was still alive, believing that by murdering as many sea creatures as possible, he could prove beyond doubt his rejection of Aranessa before the Gods.\n\nCaptain Saltspite is no longer a baby to be thrown away, however – she is the Queen of Tides, favoured by Manann, who will ensure the Sea-God has his revenge!

Many years ago, he disturbed an ancient chamber sealed with some powerful glyphs, resulting in his mind being shattered into a dozen different facets which left him teetering on the brink of insanity. Luthor thought it likely that the glyphs were of Slann origin, concluding that the best chance he had to undo his impairments was to find powerful artefacts from the same source.\n\The Slann – a powerful species of Lizardmen with an unparalleled mastery over the Sorcerous arts – are known to use many enchanted totems and trinkets of gold to serve their indecipherable purposes. The best chance of finding one was to search the most ancient ruins of the long-abandoned cities and towns of Lustria and beyond, where the Slann were most likely to have left their mark. After searching countless ruins, Luthor and his pirate horde came across a shackled slave claiming to have been a former soldier of the Empire. He told Luthor that he had recently been part of an expeditionary force that found a chest of embossed Slann Gold, but on their way back to camp they were ambushed by a vast Lizardmen army, the largest he had ever seen. The soldier narrowly escaped with his life, but everyone in his troop was slaughtered and the Lizardmen made off back to Lustria with their gold.\n\nClearly this hoard is of great importance to the Lizardmen for them to have brought such a force to take it back – there must be more to this gold than its monetary value alone. Luthor can see his goal clearly now, his mind yearning to be repaired. He needs to gather his minions, return to Lustria, and attack these cold-blooded freaks!

Very few can find it without possessing very specific navigational knowledge, but one particular enchanted instrument makes it possible for even a novice to do so – Captain Roth’s Moondial. \n\nCaptain Roth was known for being Noctilus’ one-time arch-rival, after one of Noctilus’ midnight raids led to the demise of Roth’s entire family. This led the anguished captain to lead a fleet directly to the Galleon’s Graveyard, a navigational feat only made possible with his magical moondial. Neither Noctilus or Roth were defeated outright in the immense sea battle that followed, but both suffered extensive casualties. The horrors Roth’s crew witnessed in the Galleon’s Graveyard pushed many of them to desertion following the battle. During the confusion, his moondial was opportunistically stolen, ensuring that the graveyard could never easily be found again.\n\nMuch later, following a boarding action against an Empire trading vessel crossing the Great Ocean, a clue is found – a map, supposedly leading to a treasure chest in which the moondial was last seen. Noctilus examines the map closely, feeling like he is looking at one of his own traps, but nothing was going to get in his way. The map might lead him to the moondial, or perhaps to someone who knows where it is. In any case, Noctilus will crush anyone who opposes him!

The rumours were that a band of Norscan raiders had declared war upon Manann himself in the name of their Chaos Gods, slaughtering innocent creatures of the sea, so Aranessa immediately called upon her crew to set sail for Norsca, swearing that they would pay for their villainy! \n\nAfter burning several Norscan villages to the ground, Aranessa found the information she sought, with the help of an Empire captain named Kolt Ludenhof. The raiding parties had originated from the Norscan coastal town of Skjold, whose marauders were targeting islands in the neighbouring seas, slaughtering all marine creatures they encountered and offering them as sacrifices to their Dark Gods. They were under orders from their chieftain, who claimed that the Queen of Tides must be his daughter, who he’d thought dead and lost. The truth is that he threw Aranessa into the ocean as a baby, believing she would attract the ire of the Dark Gods due to the mutations of the sea she bore, which among the Norscans are considered to be a curse. The Skjold chieftain mobilised his fleet as soon as he learned that Aranessa was still alive, believing that by murdering as many sea creatures as possible, he could prove beyond doubt his rejection of Aranessa before the Gods.\n\nCaptain Saltspite is no longer a baby to be thrown away, however – she is the Queen of Tides, favoured by Manann, who will ensure the Sea-God has his revenge!

Many years ago, he disturbed an ancient chamber sealed with some powerful glyphs, resulting in his mind being shattered into a dozen different facets which left him teetering on the brink of insanity. Luthor thought it likely that the glyphs were of Slann origin, concluding that the best chance he had to undo his impairments was to find powerful artefacts from the same source.\n\The Slann – a powerful species of Lizardmen with an unparalleled mastery over the Sorcerous arts – are known to use many enchanted totems and trinkets of gold to serve their indecipherable purposes. The best chance of finding one was to search the most ancient ruins of the long-abandoned cities and towns of Lustria and beyond, where the Slann were most likely to have left their mark. After searching countless ruins, Luthor and his pirate horde came across a shackled slave claiming to have been a former soldier of the Empire. He told Luthor that he had recently been part of an expeditionary force that found a chest of embossed Slann Gold, but on their way back to camp they were ambushed by a vast Lizardmen army, the largest he had ever seen. The soldier narrowly escaped with his life, but everyone in his troop was slaughtered and the Lizardmen made off back to Lustria with their gold.\n\nClearly this hoard is of great importance to the Lizardmen for them to have brought such a force to take it back – there must be more to this gold than its monetary value alone. Luthor can see his goal clearly now, his mind yearning to be repaired. He needs to gather his minions, return to Lustria, and attack these cold-blooded freaks!

Very few can find it without possessing very specific navigational knowledge, but one particular enchanted instrument makes it possible for even a novice to do so – Captain Roth’s Moondial. \n\nCaptain Roth was known for being Noctilus’ one-time arch-rival, after one of Noctilus’ midnight raids led to the demise of Roth’s entire family. This led the anguished captain to lead a fleet directly to the Galleon’s Graveyard, a navigational feat only made possible with his magical moondial. Neither Noctilus or Roth were defeated outright in the immense sea battle that followed, but both suffered extensive casualties. The horrors Roth’s crew witnessed in the Galleon’s Graveyard pushed many of them to desertion following the battle. During the confusion, his moondial was opportunistically stolen, ensuring that the graveyard could never easily be found again.\n\nMuch later, following a boarding action against an Empire trading vessel crossing the Great Ocean, a clue is found – a map, supposedly leading to a treasure chest in which the moondial was last seen. Noctilus examines the map closely, feeling like he is looking at one of his own traps, but nothing was going to get in his way. The map might lead him to the moondial, or perhaps to someone who knows where it is. In any case, Noctilus will crush anyone who opposes him!

false	wh2_dlc12_brt_alberic_braid_of_bordeleaux	Bordeleaux is a dukedom with long-standing maritime traditions, the inhabitants of its long coastline having had a strong relationship with the ocean by virtue of drawing much of their livelihood and sustenance from it. But across the oceans of the Old World and beyond, trouble brews. Seaborne bandits ply the straits in their ships of war, preying on those foolish enough to sail unsuitably prepared to defend their cargo from those with no qualms about taking it with deadly force. Sometimes it is not even wealth that the bloodthirsty pirates desire, with many murderous, Undead commanders simply hellbent on acquiring yet more dead bodies to raise into their zombie pirate crews.\n\nThe seafaring Bordelens are well-accustomed to having to deal with pirates, which is why Duke Alberic found it unusual that he was recently visited by several nobles from the coastal fiefdoms complaining that entire fishing fleets operating out of their estates had gone missing with increasing frequency. Renowned for his personal courage and astounding self-discipline, the duke refuses to stand by and allow his people’s livelihoods to be put at risk without taking action.\n\nThere is no better place for Alberic to begin his expedition to cleanse the oceans than Sartosa, the City of Pirates, which lies to the south on the other side of the Estalian Peninsula. Though the infamous thief-ridden port is thought to currently be under the control of the bloodthirsty sea captain Aranessa Saltspite, Alberic knows that the inherent backstabbing nature of pirates means that any number of belligerent enemies could be encountered there. He therefore scrambles his attendants to prepare for departure. Finally, he has a purpose – this may not be a Grail Quest, but it is still worthy of the aging duke’s attention.

false	wh2_dlc12_brt_fay_morgianas_mirror	There are thought to have been many Enchantresses through the centuries, and she has certainly gone by many names. And no-one really knows how many ages the current Fay Enchantress, Morgiana, has lived through, but as she travels the land between sacred groves, she draws to her side young children who harbour latent powers inside themselves, most of whom return to serve Bretonnia as Damsels.\n\nIt is fabled that one such girl was favoured above all others by the Lady of the Lake. As the story goes, when Morgiana took her from her parents, the child gifted the Fay Enchantress a most resplendent hand mirror, said to have inexplicable magical properties born of the child’s own power. Such was the potency of the artefact that the Enchantress always took it to the battlefield whenever forced into violent confrontation with her foes.\n\nNow, however, the power of Morgiana’s Mirror has waned. Upon communing with the Lady of the Lake, the Fay Enchantress discovers that the mirror’s power is closely tied to the purity of the Bretonnian soil. With the defiling taint of the many belligerent races of the Old World creeping across the land, the Enchantress’ mission is clear. The only way to restore the mirror to its full potency is to ward away all signs of corruption that may fester across the dukedoms.

false	wh2_dlc12_brt_louen_armour_of_brilliance	The Bretonnian warrior Agilulf is well known amongst the dukedom's Knightly classes. Once a great Grail Knight, he successfully embarked on countless chivalrous quests to rid the world of its foulest monsters - thousands were slain by his sword. He was also famous for the glittering armour he wore, which possessed a magical sheen that would blind his enemies in combat, frequently giving him the upper hand. No-one really knows what became of Agilulf or how he met his end, needless to say that he failed to return from his final Knightly quest and was assumed to have been killed. Neither he nor his resplendent armour were ever seen again – until today!\n\nA piece of armour bearing Agilulf’s heraldry is brought before King Louen, recovered by a group of Grail Knights returning from a holy quest. The iconography proves beyond doubt that the armour belonged to a member of Agilulf’s household, but it does not possess the fabled radiance and is surprisingly brittle. Upon consulting with the Fay Enchantress, King Louen discovers both that it is indeed Agilulf’s armour and that its sheen and durability are magically linked, its dullness and fragility an indication that its magical properties have long since waned. The only way to restore Agilulf's armour is to buff and polish until its brilliance returns, firstly by melting it down and then by re-forging it. Such work is no job for a peasant smithy – instead, this requires a master craftsman's hands.

The plagues of heinous ratmen fanning out above and beneath the jungle floor were proof that the Prophecy was coming true. The Prophet enjoyed many victories over them, and with each pathetic Skaven body slaughtered and crushed, Sotek’s worldly power grew stronger and His following – the Cult of Sotek – grew greater still. Committing wholeheartedly to the Prophecy of Sotek, the Prophet and his apostles rounded up those Skaven not slain in battle and prepared them for ritualistic sacrifice in the Serpent-God’s name. Thousands upon thousands of gibbering, jabbering rat men were dragged to the altars and snake pits, the air filled with their fear-musk mixed with the stench of their foul urine and the sounds of their pathetic whining and begging. Much Skaven blood was spilt in the Serpent-God’s name that day.\n\nNow, with Sotek’s arrival finally at hand, Tehenhauin lays an elaborate trap for the Skaven that he knows still dwell beneath the jungle floors of noble Lustria. If everything goes according to his plan, the remaining Skaven host will be driven back and then herded to Gwakmol Crater, where they would be unable to escape their certain fate. Though the Skaven outnumber the Lizardmen many times over, the Prophet’s ever-growing force is empowered by their leader’s undeniable vigour, and they feel assured of victory despite the seemingly insurmountable odds.

So Hexoatl’s greatest Terradon Rider, the legendary Master of Skies, set out to search for the cause of the disturbance atop his fearsome mount, Zwup. He had first sensed the problem upon his arrival in the Southlands, which led him to conclude that something somewhere on the continent must have been causing it.\n\nSoaring above the vast and immense jungles, Tiktaq’to searched for an explanation through the dense jungle canopy and eventually spotted vermin-like footprints on the ground below. Upon closer inspection, and utilising his highly-developed reptilian senses, he caught the distinct stench of the ratmen’s fear-musk still hanging in the humid air – the Skaven were nearby, and there had to be a link between their presence and the continued weakening of his ancient, revered artefact. After further tracking and skirmishes with small bands of Skavenslaves, Tiktaq’to and his Terradon Riders learnt of an even larger Skaven presence in the jungle. Worse still, they were causing damage to the Geomantic Web through the desecration of the temple ruins in the area, likely whilst searching for the damnable Warpstone deposits.\n\nOnly the defiling activities of the despicable Skaven could’ve caused such local disruption to the Web, in turn explaining the weakening of the blessings upon Tiktaq’to’s Mask of Heavens.

While its loss bothers Malekith, it doesn't trouble him greatly, for he is the owner of countless arcane artefacts.\n\nHowever, now it has been found – well, according to the Dreadlord, Strenious Kingslayer, it has. He brazenly enters the Black Council’s chamber and approaches the obsidian table – where the Witch King sits with his most loyal advisors – proclaiming that he knows the Supreme Spellshield’s whereabouts and will share it for a price. In the chamber sit a hundred Lords, none of whom can remember such an audacious attempt to provoke the Witch King; many see Strenious’ life lasting only seconds more!\n\nYet Malekith does not unleash his legendary rage.

Malekith makes a great show of thanking the Captain, and pays him then and there. As Strenious smiles upon the wealth he’s suddenly accumulated, the Witch King grabs the captain by the throat and casually throws him over the side of the great vessel. His fortune follows him into the sea, for Malekith cares not for riches, it is power he has always craved.\n\nStrenious’ crew do not bat an eyelid at their master’s sudden death, but quickly make themselves busy when the Witch King orders his army disembarked for an expedition to retrieve the lost shield.

It is a claim few have made directly to her face, but one she would not deny - and would actually revel in - before flaying the skin off the accuser, of course.\n\nThe instruments of such torture would be her paired weapons; the spear, Heartrender and sister blade, the Darksword.

No mere nightmare, this is a vision sent by Lileath warning of peril back on Ulthuan. The Witch King strides upon the Elven homeland once more, and he is not even contained within Anlec. Events surrounding the Great Vortex seem to be happening even faster than Loremaster Talarian could have predicted.\n\nTeclis knows that the search of Way-fragments must continue, but he cannot ignore the Witch King on Ulthuan, and so makes preparations for an early return.

Communication with the gods is never precise but it seems that she is concerned for Vaul, the Maker-God. The Witch King invades Vaul's shrine in Caledor, upon Ulthuan itself. There the Dark King spits spiteful hexes, as he besieges the enraged volcano in which Vaul's shrine sits. If not stopped, it is only a matter of time before he claims it, weakening the Asur's connection with the gods of the Cadai.\n\nTeclis must raise a host and travel to the Dragon Spine as fast as he is able.

Teclis knows Malekith must be stopped. He unsheathes his sword - a weapon forged by himself that has been quiet of late. But now it glows with power enthused by the blessing of Vaul, by battle's end it will be a formidable blade once more.

Even Teclis himself wears it only in times of great need, so he sets off to Lustria without it. However, it quickly becomes apparent that circumstances are direr than even the High Loremaster realised, and so he sends for the crown. A pair of Great Eagles are dispatched from Saphery with the crown securely held their claws. An epic journey follows, crossing the Great Ocean and then the continent itself.\n\n Perhaps it was inevitable, on a flight that long, that the Eagles would not reach Teclis. Something has gone wrong - the crown and its winged escort are lost. An artefact of such power and reverence cannot be allowed to simply vanish. Teclis knows of a ritual of Isha that should be invoked, for a mother always knows where her children lie, and the War Crown is of Isha's making.

On entering the cave, the High Elves are assaulted by a unholy stench. Some turn their noses up and even consider returning to the surface, but Teclis gives them a stern look and bids they advance further into the depths.\n\nA piercing scream echoes through the cavern; the master of the lair is in residence! Bones drop from the ceiling to come crashing amidst the High Elven host. The carcasses of two Eagles litter the cavern floor. Teclis looks up to see the hunter that ripped them from the sky - a gigantic Undead bat…\n\nBut even this beast does not seem to be alone, for in the shadows, scuttling all around the periphery of the cave, the Elves hear mocking chitters!

Reports of coastal raids are flooding into Lothern and even that the Witch King is now abroad. Fear spreads that Dark Elves land upon Ulthuan and are trying inveigle themselves into the populace - ready to pounce upon neighbours when bidden by Malekith.\n\nFinubar calls his unofficial war council of which Tyrion is the central pillar.

For an Elf, he is a being of simple tastes, and a rare straight-talker who despises dressing up his words in needless confections and double-meanings - unlike the princes that frequent the court of the Phoenix Throne.\n\nIn Tyrion’s mind it is these dandy fools that will be their race’s undoing; while they prance about court furthering their own agendas, the Vortex struggles, and invasion is imminent. Tyrion quits the court in disgust and goes about mustering a force to repel the inevitable.	Sunfang	OWN_N_UNITS	rom_event_mission.png	bst/generic	true	Quest		0	0	true	0	2140784849	false	false

The jealous princes utter a poisonous rumour in court and let's their race's proclivity for scandal do the rest... \n\nTyrion’s pride burns as deeply as any Dwarf’s, and that can make him predictable. The veiled insult eats at Tyrion - the claim that he is only so renowned because of the sword he wields has him cast it aside to prove it is not so. Yet such rumours have a tendency to grow like a spider's web, catching larger flies. Soon the talk of the courts is that Tyrion is no campaigner. While those in battle may fear the Defender of Ulthuan - on grander strategies, such as depriving the foe of hideaways or destroying enemy supply routes, Tyrion is clueless - or so the rumours asserted. Tyrion could ignore such bunkum, but his pride prevents him. He shall prove the naysayers wrong!

Such a long life has seen him, on occasion, fall into conflict with rival Slann whose interpretation of the Great Plan differs from his own. Nevertheless, when a summons comes from Lord Mazdamundi, the oldest and most powerful of all living Mage-Priests, Kroq-Gar is duty-bound to answer.\n\nThe command from Mazdamundi is weak, no doubt a result of the Great Warding’s disintegration, which in turn is due to the fading Vortex on the High Elf Isle of Ulthuan. The ancient Saurus decides that a Skink must tap into the Geomantic Web directly, to clarify Mazdamundi’s directive.

Their intention may be honourable, but they cannot be allowed to tamper with mechanisms far beyond their limited understanding.

However, since the forked-tongue comet of Sotek was seen in the heavens, the spear’s power has waned.

Killing his loyal followers is not enough to sate the Headtaker’s rage, so he lashes out at the closest enemies, for they are clearly the thieves… in some way. And deep down in his verminous mind he knows that keeping his horde busy will distract them from his own incompetence in losing one of Clan Mors' most priceless artefacts.

For a moment, Queek is tempted to rip out the messenger’s throat at this news, but realises that if he keeps killing his loyal servants he’ll run out of followers. Instead, Queek settles for a swipe with his claw, sending the inferior flying, before rearing to his full height and demanding the perpetrator must be found. He promotes the servant he has just struck to ‘chief-finder’, giving Queek a convenient scapegoat should the search prove fruitless.

Queek’s whiskers twitch in appreciation at the ego-boosting address, but otherwise he remains silent and still. "The assassin-thief has deliberately fled in Dwarf territory. I suspect a trap."\n\nQueek rises to his full height in triumph.\n\n"I knew it! Beard-things!", he says with glee. He ignores the agent’s meek protestations that he suspects a ruse, for Queek has a battle-lust about him and immediately sends his minions scuttling forth to raise a horde as quickly as possible.

But Queek waves the coward away - after all, he is Queek Headtaker, what could go wrong?

In a devious move, his minions led a large expedition from the Old World down into the long abandoned Mortuary of Tzulaqua, via a trail of worthless trinkets leading deep under the ruined pyramid. A few of the greedy fools were lost to ancient traps, but most made it to the sacrificial chamber.\n\nThere, on a simple stone plinth, rested the Liber Bubonicus. If the book was left closed they may have lived, but one of the Man-things opened the Liber Bubonicus and from its pages sprouted a thousand plague-flies. The swarm buzzed, biting, laying eggs, and spreading an awful pox. The ploy worked! The Horned Rat is surely pleased, yet Skrolk is weary and must now recuperate.

It is said that the rod was awarded to Skrolk in the wake of his blindness. When he clawed at his own eyes after bearing witness to Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch, Skrolk wished no other vision to obscure that glimpse of pestilent perfection.\n\nDespite this, Nurglitch does not brook failure, and remains unimpressed with Skrolk’s performance since the Vortex became vulnerable. Matters are not helped by the Rod of Corruption’s recent inability to cast rust upon metal. Flesh will still slough from bones when struck, but where before metal would oxidise and corrode, it remains gleaming. Skrolk suspects that the recent Vortex activity and his rod’s lack of corruption are linked, but first he must appease the Arch-Plaguelord and bolster Clan Pestilens' forces.

To outsiders he may seem to be lashing out, but those who know Skrolk know there is method in his fury. The Lizardmen hide knowledge; they have many secrets and one is the power to eat metal.

Once spread upon the Rod of Corruption, Skrolk’s weapon will be powerful once again. Then he can return to his grand schemes.\n\nFirst, he must deal with the Council while the Great Vortex remains unstable, but that is what this lick-spittle scribe is for.

Once a devout and pure Templar Priest of Sigmar, Archaon searched ancient texts for the means to destroy Chaos, but his studies proved worse than futile. Uncovering a set of heretical manuscripts, he learned a terrible truth which drove him to an unquenchable fury. Rejecting his former gods, he swore himself to the service of Chaos instead. Tearing down the temple, Archaon vowed to become the scourge of the Empire. The scrolls contained details of several artefacts of power and of a great warrior who would win the items and gain the blessing of all the Ruinous Powers. Archaon has vowed to become this man, or die in the attempt. Having cut a bloody swathe across the Empire, he has entered the dreaded Chaos Wastes. Many lesser servants of Chaos have come to follow him, but now he searches for true Warriors of Chaos, sworn "Swords" to form the core of his forces and demonstrate his might.

Other gifts are broader in scope, affecting a Chaos Lord's qualities as a leader.

The Chaos Wastes are all well and good as far as such things go, but they lack certain comforts that a man of Sigvald’s refined tastes has come to expect. Sigvald is the chosen scion of Slaanesh, the Dark Prince of Chaos. Known as the Lord of Excess, Slaanesh is the master of passions and sensual indulgence, but also of cruel torments and despairing agony. He is the patron of the obsessive, and his attention is drawn to those who inflict pain to satisfy their own desires. As the adopted son of Slaanesh, Sigvald is the personification of beauty on the outside, but rot within. He is attended by dozens who attend to his every whim and desire, but a man can never have too many admirers. As he stands in the midst of battle, preening and murmuring compliments to himself while beings die all around him, he has a whim to gather to himself a band of perfectly-skilled retainers to share in this adulation, perhaps holding mirrors that he might see himself more clearly.

Reluctantly, the Geld-Prince summons a Chaos Sorcerer to advise him.

At the head of the Cult is the Grand Theogonist, and while many have filled the role over the years, most - if not all - have been intimidating men; full of fury and bombast, and piously devoted to Sigmar's tenets.\n\nShould the Empire come under threat, then it is not always state troops that must face the threat alone. The Cult of Sigmar has often answered the call to war, with the Grand Theogonist at its head, eager as any of his Warrior Priests to smite the foe. It was on one such doomed campaign that the Jade Griffon - a talisman of the Theogonist's office, said to have been blessed by Magnus the Pious himself - went missing. The Grand Theogonist at the time was brought low by Chaos filth, and the Jade Griffon lost somewhere in Kislev.\n\nMany years later, and word has reached Volkmar the Grim that the Jade Griffon has resurfaced. The Grand Theogonist senses that the time is right to go in search of this precious antiquity. Volkmar issues a proclamation that he intends to march for Kislev. In the vanguard of his force go the desperate and the fanatical - those that have lost everything but their faith. Let their zeal light the way.

Those who know Volkmar well, such as Karl Franz, realise that this brooding nature is a fierce internal piety, frustration that Chaos still thrives and a grim determination to purge the Empire's foes. Yet the office of the Grand Theogonist has always attracted enemies, from both within and without. Volkmar, a man who has never suffered fools, has burned alliances and gained many opponents during Altdorf's courtly political games, so when the malicious rumours started to circulate about Volkmar's behaviour, there were many suspects.\n\n The rumours were few at first, but have since spread like balefire - "Volkmar communes with Daemons"; "The Grand Theogonist wishes to depose the Emperor"; "He is the arch-heretic". Despite the Emperor's urging, Volkmar refused to waste time defending himself from such vapid gossip. This played into his unseen enemy's hands, and now the Staff of Command - the symbol of the Grand Theogonist's august office - has been reluctantly taken and locked away by the Holy Order of Sigmar, such is the feeling against Volkmar. Even Franz, his closest friend, is politically tied to remain a mere observer whilst the Witch Hunters investigate the allegations, baseless as they are.\n\nSpurred on by strong support within the Cult of Sigmar, Volkmar has at last decided he must act and despatches loyal Warrior Priests throughout the realm to track down the deviant rumour-mongers.

A few tales by wary villagers back in Reikland tell of priests of the Wolf God, Ulric, besmirching Volkmar's name. Tensions between the two cults are often fraught but cordial. However, ever since Volkmar and his Arch Lectors voted against the Ar-Ulric's candidate in the election for Emperor, relations have been strained.\n\nIf the Cult of Ulric is spreading these fell rumours, then Volkmar will need the support of the Arch Lectors once more.

Yet the pages of greatest lore were missing - torn from their binding and scattered across the Empire. No doubt this was Mannfred's true agenda all along - a test - and should Ghorst be successful, he would imbue one of the nine Books of Nagash with great power once more.\n\nGhorst must begin the hunt for the missing pages immediately or risk disappointing the Gravelord, Mannfred, himself. Fast-moving Dire Wolves will allow the Necromancer to cover more ground.	Liber Noctus	ARMY_CONTAINS_N_UNITS_OF_TYPE	rom_event_mission.png	vmp/generic	true	Quest		0	0	true	0	2140784146	false	false

The Sigmarites are now searching for the last remaining pages to keep them out of Ghorst's, and ultimately Mannfred's, hands. They have tracked the pages to a site deep within the Border Princes - taken there by a Lahmian cult centuries ago, placed in a sealed casket and thrown in a deep gorge to keep them out of Nagash's necrotic hands. Burning the pages would have proved more effective, but many counter-curses ensure the Books of Nagash cannot be so easily destroyed.\n\nAnd so the Cult of Sigmar control the site, hunting for the casket.

In the past, it was a realm of several dark and doomed empires, but now it is an arid backwater dominated by the Greenskins. The Orcs and Goblins thrive in this forsaken place. It was the birthplace of many a Waaagh! that has gone on to devastate Dwarf and humie kingdoms alike. While a Waaagh! can occur ‘naturally’ sometimes these things need a catalyst. For years, that catalyst has been Wurrzag, 'Da Great Green Prophet'. \n\nHowever, word has reached the Savage Orc Shaman that some gobbo in the south is claiming to be the new prophet, denouncing Wurrzag as an "air-a-tick" and "pretenda"! Now that is fightin’ talk! Wurrzag immediately gathers loyal believers around him to put down this false prophet and prove he is the one and only true voice of da Green Godz!

Luckily he was nowhere near da drops, but in the midst of chomping on a Snotling when a particularly powerful vision struck. All night, Wurrzag remained silent and still, the half-eaten Snotling frantically trying to prise the Savage Orc’s jaws apart. When the Shaman came to, and finally emptied his mouth with a big gulp, he immediately gathered the tribe and told them of what he had seen. It was a vision of confusing sights - blood and death, ruined Dwarf Halls, a group of smug humie adventurers, and a mountain passage of black rock and fire.\n\nMost Orcs look confused, but Wurrzag is enthused with a sense of purpose. While not entirely sure what that exact purpose is, he is convinced that the lands before the Black Mountains should be taken in Gork's… or Mork’s name.

With the power of her Chalice of Potions, the Enchantress summons forth a storm of unseen enormity upon the approaching fleet.

Still they come, the very sea seeming to boil and froth beneath their prows; an invasion without end, a fight without hope. As they pour from their vessels onto the land, unstoppable, the Ruinous hordes seem intent to rip the very heart from the breast of Bretonnia...\n\nThe Fay Enchantress awakes with a start, a deep fear settling, ice cold, within her. She knows, in this moment, that this was no mere nightmare but a vision - sent by the Lady - of what could be, should her strength be insufficient to stop it.

The first point of the ritual lies in Nordland, to the east, far across the marches and into the lands of the Empire of Man. Knowing that time is crucial, and that Chaos grows ever-nearer, she dispatches a faithful servant to Nordland to begin the ritual.

They are so many, it is as if a great cloak is reaching across the ocean. Panic grips the people, but the Enchantress remains calm.\n\nUpon the shores, she grasps the Chalice of Potions and channels its power in the name of the Lady. The ritual draws power from the swirling and tumultuous Winds of Magic, conjuring a dark and vicious storm. Bolts of lightning arc down at the approaching fleet, dashing them to pieces, whilst winds of enormous magnitude hurl yet more ships away to a watery demise. The spell is beyond anything ever seen before, and far greater than the one in the Enchantress' vision. When it is done, most of the fleet is consigned to oblivion. Yet despite it all, more advance. A sizeable force lands upon Bretonnian shores, still intent on seeing the land burn.\n\nThe Enchantress knows what must be done.

Amongst the northern tribes there are tales of one such monstrous Frost-Wyrm called Frigustrex, Scion of the Cold-Void, that has terrorised the tundra for centuries. Witnesses say that when coming out of hibernation it emerges from the ground in a heartbeat to indiscriminately devour anything that gets too close to its territory, located somewhere at the frozen northern end of Troll Country.\n\nRecently, the Tower of Khrakk and the Kislevite lands to the south were inexplicably blanketed by freakishly bad snow storms, with entire tribes disappearing from the region without a trace. Witnesses were saying that it was not the icy weather that swallowed their fellow tribesmen up, but a giant Dragonish shadow lurking in the blinding blizzard.\n\nIf there is even the slightest chance that this shadow was the fabled Frigustrex itself, then it is worth investigating further.

It is an abominable creature spoken about only in nightmarish tales shrouded in myth, the fragments of truth of which are unknown to most.\n\nIn your hunt for the Abyssal Shrieker you obtained a leather-bound notebook containing a written history of the last individual who had attempted to kill it. This long-dead hunter was once a noble of Stirland, which for a time was frequently haunted by the mysterious centuries-old monster, so he set out to kill it himself. According to the notebook, the great Lord failed to slay the beast after a vicious battle, from which he only narrowly escaped with his life. Although he survived the encounter, he paid a terrible price for his defeat. The Terrorgheist absorbed almost all of his lifeforce and strength to make itself even more powerful, leaving the once-great hunter a sickly, weak individual, an affliction suffered by his entire family and bloodline. Withered and disgraced, the noble and his kin exiled themselves to Sylvania where they all eventually perished in shame.\n\nClearly, this pathetic Stirlander was nowhere near as great a hunter as you! He at least managed to record the location of his defeat, which you assume to be in the vicinity of the Abyssal Shrieker’s lair. All that remains to do is travel to Wurtbad to find it.

With the reclamation of the World's Edge Mountains underway, Thorgrim’s thoughts turn northwards to the once-mighty Hold of Kraka Drak in Norsca. If the Norscan Dwarfs have endured the Time of Woes and Kraka Drak remains unconquered, it would be invaluable in the struggle against the Norscan tribes who feed the forces of Chaos. The High King dispatches agents northwards to discover the fate of the Norse Dwarfs.

Though Gromril weapons are amongst the most deadly in the Old World, the replacement section is blank, lacking the runes of power that are etched into the rest of the blade.

The competition even to become a candidate is white hot. Wizards, being what they are, mean the selection process is at best pedantic; at its worst, real enmities can develop.

While this is an open secret, no direct accusation can be made as that is not how wizards manage their affairs.

Unfortunately, the abbey is well defended by the forces of the local duke, meaning that any straightforward attack upon it would prove costly.

The Slayer nods a greeting as Grombrindal sits down beside him. Gotrek offers the horn, and the White Dwarf drinks mightily - although it is a thirst not truly earned. The two legends share a few words, and Gotrek makes to leave soon after, for he has an umgi poet to find. He does offer some sage advice before disappearing into the night: the Warboss at the centre of this Waaagh! is gathering together a mighty horde of monsters. Gurnisson suggests he recruit a  group of Slayers he can vouch for. Gotrek would join himself, but this umgi partner of his seems to be missing and no doubt needs to rescued.\n\nThe meeting of two great Dawi heroes ends, and Grombrindal sets out to find the Slayers.
