false	wh2_dlc09_great_vortex_skv_tretch_lucky_skullhelm_stage_3	Tretch’s luck holds once again.

false	wh2_dlc09_great_vortex_tmb_arkhan_the_tomb_blade_of_arkhan_stage_2	There is little left of this city's past splendour. Its crumbling edifices and dilapidated porticos are host to naught now but the desert winds. The agent scours the ruins, and eventually locates the entrance to a grand tomb, with Alcadizaar's name barely legible over the grand architrave. In front of the tomb lie the bodies of Lizardmen, entangled with mouldering remains. The blood and ichor is still wet: this skirmish was recent. Perhaps the battle still rages within?

false	wh2_dlc09_great_vortex_tmb_settra_the_crown_of_nehekhara_stage_3	The raid was a success. A barbarian chief, draped in ancient gold and gem-studded trinkets, is dragged before Settra. He is larger by far than the average human and wears a growling mask of surliness, but Settra revels in the terror that lurks behind his eyes. The creature's soul is forfeit, of course; Phakth demands eternal justice, and Settra his due. What will be the manner of this insect's passing?	The Crown of Nehekhara	generic	false	Quest

true	wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_almighty_monuments	A new monument will show the gods that their veneration is still our foremost concern.

true	wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_crumbling_buildings	In cities as old as the deserts it is the natural order that even the finest buildings eventually crumble and fall.

true	wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_drying_rivers	The main tributary used for trade and transport of materials from one holy site to another is slowly drying out.

true	wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_eternal_servitude	The Liche Priests of the Mortuary Cult have left their necropoli in search of servants to aid them in their holy work; the incantations of preservation must be maintained and furthered.

true	wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_glorious_structures	The cities of Nehekhara are without compare in their scale and grandeur.

Splendid Structures	civilisation_up	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma	
true	wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_liche_priest	Liche Priests should live only to serve their king's undying will. Betrayal should be anathema to their order, yet one among their number has betrayed us by conspiring with a rival Tomb King. How should we proceed?	Judas Priest	politics	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma	
true	wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_lost_tombs	During the excavation of one of our Lord's tombs, a disaster occurred; the more we dug, the more sand poured into the breach, trapping our unfortunate workers inside and re-sealing the chamber. Is the loss of a few wretched labourers sufficient reason to dig elsewhere? Or should we persevere here and redouble our efforts?	Lost Tomb, Hidden Knowledge	faction	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma	
true	wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_scaly_sacrifice	Whilst traversing the jungles on the edge of the world, with a view to bringing them within our sphere of influence, our forces have encountered a village of tribal Lizardmen.

true	wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_sinking_pyramid	Despite the best efforts of our chief Necrotect, one of our tombs has started to sink back into the sand once more, before giving up its illustrious, arcane secrets; if we do not act quickly to shore up its entrance, we risk losing everything we have thus far gained.

true	wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_soulless_sphinx	One of our Liche Priests has dared approach with concerns that one of the Necrosphinxes is no longer under the control of our warriors' souls but instead is in thrall to Usekph, the destructive god buried beneath the sands. Dare we destroy it and risk his unending wrath?	Soulless Sphinx	politics	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma	
true	wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_stray_mortals	Men, whose flesh still crowds their bones, with hearts that continue to beat, have been found wandering the land.

true	wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_the_banisher	We have made a great discovery! During the course of our excavations, remains of the army that once served Alcadizaar the Conqueror, the last and maybe the greatest of all the Priest Kings of Nehekhara, have been unearthed. It would take but a little magic to raise them to our service, should we do so or give them a ritual burial in the classical Nehekharan style?

false	wh2_dlc10_monster_hunt_10_stage_2	Dargoth is in the aftermath of some attack. The towers still burn even amongst the snow and ice, and the bodies of the recently-mauled litter the ground. The survivors look upon the Norse with suspicion and hostility. It is clear your force does not come to offer aid. You speak out, asking if this was the work of the immortal War Hydra. You get only silence in response...	Monster Hunt: The Beast of Raema	faction	true	Quest		
false	wh2_dlc10_nor_monster_hunt_10_dilemma_reward	The legendary monster has been slain! The tribesmen flock to catch a glimpse of the fallen beast, bearing witness to your glorious achievement.

false	wh2_dlc10_qb_nor_monster_hunt_8_stage_2	This scheming Druchii trader has been surprisingly forthcoming thus far, but as you suspect, it is not long before he proposes a bargain. He is willing to hand over the extinguished Phoenix pinion, stating that it will prove useful on the hunt to come, and provide the location of the volcano in which the Mother of the Flame is reborn into this world.\n\nHowever, there is a cost; he has need of a favour regarding an unrelated matter. He wishes to divert you from your hunt - only temporarily - to kill one of his enemies. He claims he has bad credit with the assassins of his own race, so requires the murderous skills of your men. Once the death is certified he will hand over the pinion and the information you need to continue the hunt.	Monster Hunt: Mother of the Flame	messenger	true	Quest		
false	wh2_dlc10_sword_of_khaine_lv1	You wield the power of Khaine's might. The sword strikes terror in all your enemies. On the battlefield you reap a mighty toll as foes fall before the blade with ease. Yet, nightmares torment your soul, and a sickness leeches into your lands... \n\nPerhaps it is wiser to relinquish such power? You will be weaker... feebler... but is it not a price worth paying to becalm your dreams?	The Sword Hungers	sword_of_khaine	true	Quest		
false	wh2_dlc10_sword_of_khaine_lv2	Is the sword now controlling your decisions? Your power is absolute - a force to match the gods themselves - but your moods are permanently dark, your allies lose confidence, and your followers surely plot regicide. You reign over hollow lands and a desperate folk who now despise their sovereign!\n\nWill you give up this power to rule the world?	The Sword Festers	sword_of_khaine	true	Quest		
false	wh2_dlc10_sword_of_khaine_lv3	Through battle, the sword grows ever stronger, while at home your lands fester and become more corrupted with the passing of time. You must choose whether to continue down this darkest of paths…	The Sword Hungers	sword_of_khaine	true	Quest		
false	wh2_dlc10_sword_of_khaine_pick_or_not	The Sword of Khaine will always be drawn to the powerful.

The Sword Calls to You	sword_of_khaine	true	Quest		
false	wh2_dlc11_cst_cylostra_the_bordeleaux_flabellum_stage_4	A self-obsessed singer needs a doting audience, and Cylostra is well aware that it is the Bretonnians who appreciate her talents the most. After all, it was a Bretonnian king who once favoured her above all other court singers, frequently inviting the diva to give private performances and serenade eminent guests at important stately banquets.\n\nOn the other hand, Cylostra is technically still well overdue for a high-profile performance before the High Elves of Ulthuan. Many years ago, when the Lamprey succumbed to a storm in the Eastern Straits of the Great Ocean, before Cylostra’s transformation, she was on an important diplomatic voyage to sing before the Phoenix King. A treaty of great import was reliant on his pleasure in her performance, for the Elves believe good art – music in particular – to be as valuable as gems and gold. It was an important engagement, so surely the High Elves will still be waiting for her?!\n\nTo find an audience, Cylostra could head east from the islands of Northern Yvresse towards Bretonnia, retracing the fateful voyage which led to her transforming into the eternally-vengeful spirit she has become. Alternatively, she could head towards the southern end of the Shifting Isles, where the High Elves' Old World shipping lanes are located, following them directly into the great Elven port of Lothern and, hopefully, to the Phoenix King himself...

true	wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_ancient_treasure	Although most entrepreneurial, our endeavours 'ave presented something of a dilemma. A large, jewel-adorned statue of sandstone has... found its way into our possession. It's far too large to take away 'ole, but its adornments would make quite the prize! It's also covered in glyphs indicating woe might befall any who mistreat it, but that's probably just flannel so less tenacious pirates leave it alone. Should we ignore the markings an' loot its jewels or be wary?	Ancient Treasure 	politics	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma	
true	wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_camp_fortune	Ahoy there! We've come across an enemy encampment devoid of life an' littered with corpses. Half-devoured bodies are scattered about the clearing.

Fleshy Fortune	faction	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma	
true	wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_great_golden_idol	Apparently, a great Lizardmen temple 'as been unearthed. Though most of it is dilapidated, a single statue stands at the centre of what was likely a ceremonial garden - it must be worth a fortune, but removing it will certainly cause the temple to collapse, which will surely draw somebody's ire. Should we take the idol an' ignore the consequences or be cautious not to attract too much attention - an' their cold, unforgiving bloodlust, our way?	Great Golden Idol 	politics	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma	
true	wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_great_naval_battle	A major naval battle has ended, leavin' hundreds dead on each side. Death is no barrier to continued service, as well you know - those who fell in battle would make fine new recruits.

true	wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_grim_tidings	The tides seem uneasy an' force us off course. Could this be a warning from Manann? This would not be the first time he has guided us out of danger - should we continue our course or take heed?	Grim Tidings 	generic	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma	
true	wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_ocean_of_opportunities	'Conversations' with several captured admirals 'ave brought information to light regarding several potential targets.

true	wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_pirate_haven	A rival band o'pirates 'ave requested access to some of our coves an' are willing for pay for it.

true	wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_shyish_wanes	Those purple Winds of Magic are strangely absent 'round these parts, makin' the bindings that tie our troops to this world an' our will tenuous at best!

false	wh2_dlc11_great_vortex_cst_cylostra_the_bordeleaux_flabellum_stage_4	A self-obsessed singer needs a doting audience, and Cylostra is well aware that it is the Bretonnians who appreciate her talents the most. After all, it was a Bretonnian king who once favoured her above all other court singers, frequently inviting the diva to give private performances and serenade eminent guests at important stately banquets.\n\nOn the other hand, Cylostra is technically still well overdue for a high-profile performance before the High Elves of Ulthuan. Many years ago, when the Lamprey succumbed to a storm in the Eastern Straits of the Great Ocean, before Cylostra’s transformation, she was on an important diplomatic voyage to sing before the Phoenix King. A treaty of great import was reliant on his pleasure in her performance, for the Elves believe good art – music in particular – to be as valuable as gems and gold. It was an important engagement, so surely the High Elves will still be waiting for her?!\n\nTo find an audience, Cylostra could head east from the islands of Northern Yvresse towards Bretonnia, retracing the fateful voyage which led to her transforming into the eternally-vengeful spirit she has become. Alternatively, she could head towards the southern end of the Shifting Isles, where the High Elves' Old World shipping lanes are located, following them directly into the great Elven port of Lothern and, hopefully, to the Phoenix King himself...

false	wh_dlc07_brt_confederation_artois	The forested realm of Artois has notable significance in Bretonnia’s history – it was the location of the first Gathering of the Companions, where the fourteen newly-united dukedoms were first legitimised. Emblazoned on the Heraldry of Artois is the head of the monstrous boar Morthanok, symbol of Lord Folgar, the first Duke of Artois. A renowned hunter and lancer, Folgar's skills made him an invaluable Companion Knight who fought in several Great Battles alongside Gilles le Breton. Morthanok’s image is a reminder of the inaugural feast of the Companions, for which Folgar hunted down and slew the dangerous beast.	Heraldry of Artois	politics	true	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma

After slaying one such beast – the ancient Dragon Smearghus – he not only adopted its image on his Heraldry, but also wore its skin as part of his armour during all his Great Battles.

Those residing on the coastlines assert that the Lady’s domain ends where the water turns salt – where the domain of Manann begins. The tempestuous Sea God’s tri-forked symbol is a reminder of the bond he forged with the bloodline of the Bordelen dukes, during the Tenth Great Battle, against the sea-raiders from the North.

false	wh_dlc07_brt_confederation_bretonnia	King Leoncoeur's homeland of Couronne currently flies the heraldry of Bretonnia. The heritage of Couronne’s dukedom has ties to the original Grail Companions of Gilles the Uniter – their first duke was the heroic Carleond, saviour of the city and older brother of the most devoted Companion of them all, Thierulf of Lyonesse. As children, the two brothers were said to have miraculously slain a great lion together, which is why the heraldries of Lyonesse and Couronne – and hence, the heraldry of Bretonnia – display a lion’s image.

false	wh_dlc07_brt_confederation_carcassonne	It was Duke Lambard of Carcassonne, one of the famed Companions of Gilles the Uniter, who first adopted the image of the sword for his nation’s heraldry. Although Carcassonne was one of few Bretonnian provinces that did not see a Great Battle on its lands, Lambard rode out to fight victoriously in nine of them. The blade symbolises Carcassonne’s warrior-culture, attested by their centuries-old tradition of gifting every newborn son a freshly-forged sword, which they are made to touch as soon as they enter the world. It is then ornamentally placed above their cots until it can be wielded.	Heraldry of Carcassonne	politics	true	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma

In the years before the Great Battles, Thierulf of Lyonesse married Gilles’ sister and became his brother-in-law’s most trusted friend. He would later be one of the two Companions blessed by the Lady alongside Gilles himself, going on to fight victoriously in all twelve of the Great Battles with him.

It is said to be a likeness of his winged steed Glorfinial, lord and sire of all Royal pegasi, whom he befriended.

false	wh_main_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_slayer_crown_stage_3	The scout watching Sylvania's border reports a chance encounter with a terrified Sylvanian peasant who lay hidden and witnessed the passing of a hideous army of the dead. At its head rode two pale figures on dead horses, one in crimson armour, the other robed in black. The armoured figure slapped his mount's neck with a mailed fist and cursed in a voice as cold as death "Weeks of searching the mountain caves and still you have failed to find what I desire. If you are wrong about the locations to the northwest and we should find no dragon's corpse to serve me into death, I shall feast upon your soul". It seems that the Undead Lord is searching for new materials for use in his foul Necromancy. It would seem that the dead have found at least two possible locations for what they seek and are now moving to claim their vile prize.

Though the informant only caught a glimpse of her retreating back in the faint moonlight, he swears that her steed was a thing of bone with a fell green glow about it. The Witch Hunter suspects her to be an agent of the Undead.
