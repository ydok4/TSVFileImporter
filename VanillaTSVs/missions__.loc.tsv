missions_localised_description_wh_dlc01_chs_prince_sigvald_auric_armour_stage_1	Prince Sigvald the Magnificent is bored. The Chaos Wastes are all well and good as far as such things go, but they lack certain comforts that a man of Sigvald’s refined tastes has come to expect. Sigvald is the chosen scion of Slaanesh, the Dark Prince of Chaos. Known as the Lord of Excess, Slaanesh is the master of passions and sensual indulgence, but also of cruel torments and despairing agony. He is the patron of the obsessive, and his attention is drawn to those who inflict pain to satisfy their own desires. As the adopted son of Slaanesh, Sigvald is the personification of beauty on the outside, but rot within. He is attended by dozens who attend to his every whim and desire, but a man can never have too many admirers. As he stands in the midst of battle, preening and murmuring compliments to himself while beings die all around him, he has a whim to gather to himself a band of perfectly-skilled retainers to share in this adulation, perhaps holding mirrors that he might see himself more clearly.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc01_chs_prince_sigvald_auric_armour_stage_2	Prince Sigvald is not happy. The field of battle is his playground, where his dark father can revel in his son’s cruel deeds. But it is also a place of squalor, of mud, blood and ordure. In every battle, Sigvald is constantly inconvenienced by the need to clean some vile taint from his otherwise spotless armour, be it dirt or the lifeblood of his latest victim. These interruptions are irksome in the extreme and they deprive his followers of precious moments in which to admire and praise their Lord’s perfection. Reluctantly, the Geld-Prince summons a Chaos Sorcerer to advise him. Though the man bears unsightly mutations and cannot be described as sweet-smelling, the fact that he has traded his very soul in servitude to the magic of the Dark Gods means that he may be able to suggest a solution.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_claw_storm_daemon_stage_1	Right now, all of Ikit Claw’s not inconsiderable intellect is ranged against the hated Lizardmen, against whom, in a rare moment of solidarity, the various Skaven clans have united. He understands very well that direct confrontation with the Lizardmen is not viable, but wiping those tiresome toads from the face of the world has to remain the priority, as Ikit knows the Lizardmen are plotting the demise of all Skaven with equal vigour. He needs to find a way to weaken them before facing them in battle and fancies there will be no better way than corrupting their ‘blessed’ spawning pools. The location of these are of course unknown, but this doesn’t present much of a problem – the Chief Warlock Engineer isn’t above extracting the information he needs from enemy captives himself, when the need arises…	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_claw_storm_daemon_stage_2	After hours of brutal torture, involving several different nightmarish devices designed to deliver the truth in between bouts of screaming agony, Ikit is just getting into his stride when a location is finally revealed by the unfortunate captive. Turning to his assistants, he draws his claw across his own throat in silent instruction; immediately, they move in to relieve the dying Lizardman of what little remains of his miserable life. There’s no time to waste – Ikit must send a spy to confirm that the spawning pools are indeed where they are supposed to be.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_claw_storm_daemon_stage_3	Having confirmed the spawning pools’ location, Ikit Claw moves in for the kill by bringing his multifarious capabilities to bear. Always looking for new ways to bring about the destruction of his enemies, he plans to use a new device to blast the Chaos Moon so fragments rain down and corrupt not just the spawning pools themselves, but also the entire surrounding area. If successful, this scheme will deliver the added bonus of supplying Ikit with almost endless deposits of Warpstone to fuel further experiments back at his Forbidden Workshop. To better achieve his goal, Ikit now decides to construct a Warpstone beam to blast chunks from the Chaos Moon and guide them directly to their target.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_claw_storm_daemon_stage_4	No plan survives contact with an enemy, not even one formulated by the great Ikit Claw, and certainly not when faced with such an advanced foe as the perfidious Lizardmen. Irritatingly, the ever-watchful Slann Astromancers must have spotted the blasted Warpstone closing in, for they are fully battle-ready, and a Skaven scouting party reports that additional reinforcements are already on their way. Collecting some of the pure, fallen Warpstone from the field, Ikit repairs his deadly Warp-lightning thrower, Storm Daemon, and steels himself for the fray. There’s nothing else for it – he must hold his ground and make use of the chaos caused by the storm to gain advantage on the battlefield.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_great_vortex_lzd_tehenhauin_plaque_of_sotek_stage_4_other	With each victory, with each pathetic Skaven body slaughtered and crushed, Sotek’s worldly power grows stronger and His following – the Cult of Sotek – grows greater still. Even a great triumph over the ancient enemy such as this, however, cannot sate the rasping thirst of the Serpent-God for the blood and lifeforce of His mortal enemy. Tehenhauin, therefore, commits wholeheartedly to the Prophecy foretold upon the Plaque of Sotek, happily rounding up those Skaven not slain in battle and preparing them for ritualistic sacrifice in the Serpent-God’s name.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_great_vortex_lzd_tehenhauin_plaque_of_sotek_stage_5_other	Sacrifices of great importance involve, as you might expect, the ritual killing of thousands upon thousands of gibbering, jabbering rat men, and the air is filled with their fear-musk mixed with the stench of their foul urine and the sounds of their pathetic whining and begging. With the sacrificial victims shackled, anointed and otherwise prepared for their ignominious ends, Tehenhauin is ready for yet another great sacrifice to the Sotek the Serpent-God. Though the venerable Slann will never permit filthy Skaven captives to enter their revered temple-cities, the Prophet’s ritual ceremony will nevertheless go ahead as planned: Skaven blood will be spilt this fine day!	true

Grave goods there are aplenty but the amulet is not among them, and even the most rapacious looter amongst the surviving men is strangely reluctant to so much as lay a finger on any of the treasures piled amid the ancient bones.

Very few can find it without possessing very specific navigational knowledge, but one particular enchanted instrument makes it possible for even a novice to do so – Captain Roth’s Moondial. \n\nCaptain Roth was known for being Noctilus’ one-time arch-rival, after one of Noctilus’ midnight raids led to the demise of Roth’s entire family. This led the anguished captain to lead a fleet directly to the Galleon’s Graveyard, a navigational feat only made possible with his magical moondial. Neither Noctilus or Roth were defeated outright in the immense sea battle that followed, but both suffered extensive casualties. The horrors Roth’s crew witnessed in the Galleon’s Graveyard pushed many of them to desertion following the battle. During the confusion, his moondial was opportunistically stolen, ensuring that the graveyard could never easily be found again.\n\nMuch later, following a boarding action against an Empire trading vessel crossing the Great Ocean, a clue is found – a map, supposedly leading to a treasure chest in which the moondial was last seen. Noctilus examines the map closely, feeling like he is looking at one of his own traps, but nothing was going to get in his way. The map might lead him to the moondial, or perhaps to someone who knows where it is. In any case, Noctilus will crush anyone who opposes him!	true

missions_localised_description_wh_main_vmp_heinrich_kemmler_cloak_of_mists_stage_1	Morbidly questing after the secrets of death, a Necromancer deeply steeped in the lore of the dead stands on the threshold between worlds, neither wholly alive, nor one of the Undead. As a Master Necromancer, Heinrich Kemmler’s thirst for power has seen him plunder countless lichyards and sacred tombs in search of ominous artefacts or the raw materials for his hideous arcane experiments. Now the Lichemaster is on the trail of the resting place of an ancient tribal king: Marbad of the Endal tribe. Marbad fought alongside Sigmar himself in the great wars that saw the birth of the Empire. A once-powerful man, his tomb will doubtless contain vestiges of his great spirit, and Kemmler intends to bend this to his own purposes. The search begins in the libraries and archives of the Empire.	true

He fell in battle against a Greenskin horde, sacrificing himself to save the man who would unite the tribes of men into the Empire. Such greatness of spirit is a noble thing for most men, but to Kemmler it represents only a potential source of power waiting to be tapped. The tomb will doubtless contain vestiges of Marbad’s spirit, and Kemmler intends to bend this to his own purposes. Texts looted from the Empire’s scriptoriums indicate a location somewhere in Middenland, but the exact site remains a secret, almost certainly to deter the activities of fiends such as Kemmler.

After a titanic effort, however, Alcadizaar finally smashed the Undead forces. The Vampires fled to new refuges in the Old World, while Nagash retreated once more in abject fury. This time, his wrath was absolute – he cast a foul contagion throughout Nehekhara, scouring it of all life. Only Alcadizaar did he spare to witness the horror.	true

Ascending to the dark sorcerer's altar, the emaciated king caught Nagash mid-ritual: he bellowed a final war-cry and ran the sorcerer through with the crackling blade.

He swiftly rose to become a powerful high priest, but envy of his brother, who succeeded their father as king, burned within Nagash like a brazier coal. Seizing his opportunity, he entombed his brother, Thutep, alive and claimed the throne for himself - thus began Nagash's reign of sorcerous terror.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_lzd_tiktaqto_mask_of_heavens_mp	Having felt the power of his Mask of Heavens fading, Tiktaq’to had an inkling that something was amiss. So Hexoatl’s greatest Terradon Rider, the legendary Master of Skies, set out to search for the cause of the disturbance atop his fearsome mount, Zwup. He had first sensed the problem upon his arrival in the Southlands, which led him to conclude that something somewhere on the continent must have been causing it.\n\nSoaring above the vast and immense jungles, Tiktaq’to searched for an explanation through the dense jungle canopy and eventually spotted vermin-like footprints on the ground below. Upon closer inspection, and utilising his highly-developed reptilian senses, he caught the distinct stench of the ratmen’s fear-musk still hanging in the humid air – the Skaven were nearby, and there had to be a link between their presence and the continued weakening of his ancient, revered artefact. After further tracking and skirmishes with small bands of Skavenslaves, Tiktaq’to and his Terradon Riders learnt of an even larger Skaven presence in the jungle. Worse still, they were causing damage to the Geomantic Web through the desecration of the temple ruins in the area, likely whilst searching for the damnable Warpstone deposits.\n\nOnly the defiling activities of the despicable Skaven could’ve caused such local disruption to the Web, in turn explaining the weakening of the blessings upon Tiktaq’to’s Mask of Heavens. Now he has acquired this knowledge, there is little else to be done but head to their last known location and slaughter every last one of the blasphemous Skaven-spawn with extreme prejudice!	true

But Queek waves the coward away - after all, he is Queek Headtaker, what could go wrong? A messenger intercepted in an off-shoot tunnel is captured, on his way to report to the Grand Warlord himself - this was nothing but a ruse by Gnawdwell himself to keep Queek on his toes! Headtaker takes the news surprisingly well, as he relishes the opportunity to kill lots of Dwarfs and prove himself to his master!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_skv_queek_headtaker_dwarfgouger_stage_1	Curses! Dwarf Gouger has been stolen. Queek immediately slays two of his most trusted lieutenants, who were clearly to blame; it is irrelevant that he was the last one in possession of it! Killing his loyal followers is not enough to sate the Headtaker’s rage, so he lashes out at the closest enemies, for they are clearly the thieves… in some way. And deep down in his verminous mind he knows that keeping his horde busy will distract them from his own incompetence in losing one of Clan Mors' most priceless artefacts.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_skv_queek_headtaker_dwarfgouger_stage_3	Queek’s agent returns to his master. He approaches cautiously, sniffing the air to pick up what mood the Headtaker is in. As expected, Queek is impatient but stays his wrath until the ‘chief-finder’ has given his report.\n\n "Most vengeful of warrior-lords", begins the agent, with tail flat on the floor in a sign of submission. Queek’s whiskers twitch in appreciation at the ego-boosting address, but otherwise he remains silent and still. "The assassin-thief has deliberately fled in Dwarf territory. I suspect a trap."\n\nQueek rises to his full height in triumph.\n\n"I knew it! Beard-things!", he says with glee. He ignores the agent’s meek protestations that he suspects a ruse, for Queek has a battle-lust about him and immediately sends his minions scuttling forth to raise a horde as quickly as possible.       	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_skv_queek_headtaker_dwarfgouger_stage_2	In the aftermath of Queek’s real - or maybe false - rage, one of his snivelling minions approaches and concludes that a Clan Eshin assassin was the actual thief. For a moment, Queek is tempted to rip out the messenger’s throat at this news, but realises that if he keeps killing his loyal servants he’ll run out of followers. Instead, Queek settles for a swipe with his claw, sending the inferior flying, before rearing to his full height and demanding the perpetrator must be found. He promotes the servant he has just struck to ‘chief-finder’, giving Queek a convenient scapegoat should the search prove fruitless.	true

At last, after weeks or perhaps months of aimless wandering, Archaon determines to seek answers from one of the Chaos Sorcerers who have attached themselves to his horde. Such mortals barter fractions of their souls in exchange for greater magical powers.

The fact that the enemy are searching over a large area, and in libraries as well as tombs, suggests that they are yet to discover the amulet's precise location.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_qb_cst_noctilus_captain_roths_moondial_MP	Having put together a crew of unspeakable horrors, Count Noctilus decided to ensure his supremacy over the seas stayed unsurpassed, and that the Galleon’s Graveyard remains out of the reach of rival Necromancers also hoping to harness the boundless power emanating from the Maelstrom. Very few can find it without possessing very specific navigational knowledge, but one particular enchanted instrument makes it possible for even a novice to do so – Captain Roth’s Moondial. \n\nCaptain Roth was known for being Noctilus’ one-time arch-rival, after one of Noctilus’ midnight raids led to the demise of Roth’s entire family. This led the anguished captain to lead a fleet directly to the Galleon’s Graveyard, a navigational feat only made possible with his magical moondial. Neither Noctilus or Roth were defeated outright in the immense sea battle that followed, but both suffered extensive casualties. The horrors Roth’s crew witnessed in the Galleon’s Graveyard pushed many of them to desertion following the battle. During the confusion, his moondial was opportunistically stolen, ensuring that the graveyard could never easily be found again.\n\nMuch later, following a boarding action against an Empire trading vessel crossing the Great Ocean, a clue is found – a map, supposedly leading to a treasure chest in which the moondial was last seen. Noctilus examines the map closely, feeling like he is looking at one of his own traps, but nothing was going to get in his way. The map might lead him to the moondial, or perhaps to someone who knows where it is. In any case, Noctilus will crush anyone who opposes him!	true

Volkmar, a man who has never suffered fools, has burned alliances and gained many opponents during Altdorf's courtly political games, so when the malicious rumours started to circulate about Volkmar's behaviour, there were many suspects.\n\n The rumours were few at first, but have since spread like balefire - "Volkmar communes with Daemons"; "The Grand Theogonist wishes to depose the Emperor"; "He is the arch-heretic". Despite the Emperor's urging, Volkmar refused to waste time defending himself from such vapid gossip. This played into his unseen enemy's hands, and now the Staff of Command - the symbol of the Grand Theogonist's august office - has been reluctantly taken and locked away by the Holy Order of Sigmar, such is the feeling against Volkmar. Even Franz, his closest friend, is politically tied to remain a mere observer whilst the Witch Hunters investigate the allegations, baseless as they are.\n\nSpurred on by strong support within the Cult of Sigmar, Volkmar has at last decided he must act and despatches loyal Warrior Priests throughout the realm to track down the deviant rumour-mongers.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc04_emp_volkmar_the_grim_staff_of_command_stage_2	While tending to their flocks, the Warrior Priests counter the rumours about their liege and spread words of truth - of Volkmar's faith and devotion to Sigmar. They also gather intelligence on the source of these lies, yet no instigator is found.\n\nAll is not lost, there are a couple of possible leads. A few tales by wary villagers back in Reikland tell of priests of the Wolf God, Ulric, besmirching Volkmar's name. Tensions between the two cults are often fraught but cordial. However, ever since Volkmar and his Arch Lectors voted against the Ar-Ulric's candidate in the election for Emperor, relations have been strained.\n\nIf the Cult of Ulric is spreading these fell rumours, then Volkmar will need the support of the Arch Lectors once more.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_lzd_tehenhauin_plaque_of_sotek_stage_5	Sacrifices of great importance involve, as you might expect, the ritual killing of thousands upon thousands of gibbering, jabbering rat men, and the air is filled with their fear-musk mixed with the stench of their foul urine and the sounds of their pathetic whining and begging. With the sacrificial victims shackled, anointed and otherwise prepared for their ignominious ends, Tehenhauin is ready for yet another great sacrifice to the Sotek the Serpent-God. Though the venerable Slann will never permit filthy Skaven captives to enter their revered temple-cities, the Prophet’s ritual ceremony will nevertheless go ahead as planned: Skaven blood will be spilt this fine day!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_lzd_tehenhauin_plaque_of_sotek_stage_4	With each victory, with each pathetic Skaven body slaughtered and crushed, Sotek’s worldly power grows stronger and His following – the Cult of Sotek – grows greater still. Even a great triumph over the ancient enemy such as this, however, cannot sate the rasping thirst of the Serpent-God for the blood and lifeforce of His mortal enemy. Tehenhauin, therefore, commits wholeheartedly to the Prophecy foretold upon the Plaque of Sotek, happily rounding up those Skaven not slain in battle and preparing them for ritualistic sacrifice in the Serpent-God’s name.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_claw_storm_daemon_mp	Ikit Claw understands very well that direct confrontation with the Lizardmen is not viable, but wiping those tiresome toads from the face of the world always remains a priority, as the Lizardmen plot the demise of all Skaven with equal vigour. In an effort to weaken them before facing them in battle, he set into motion a plan to corrupt their ‘blessed’ spawning pools. Bringing his multifarious capabilities to bear, Ikit used a Warpstone Tractor Beam of his own design to blast the Chaos Moon, raining down fragments to corrupt not just the Lizardmen’s spawning pools themselves, but also the entire surrounding area. The outrageous scheme would deliver the added bonus of supplying Ikit with bountiful deposits of Warpstone to fuel further experiments back at his Forbidden Workshop.\n\nNo plan survives contact with an enemy, however, not even one formulated by the great Ikit Claw, and certainly not when faced with such an advanced foe as the perfidious Lizardmen. Irritatingly, the ever-watchful Slann Astromancers had spotted the falling Warpstone as Ikit approached so are fully battle-ready, and a Skaven scouting party reports that additional Lizardmen reinforcements are already on their way. Collecting some of the pure, fallen Warpstone from the field, Ikit repairs his deadly Warp-lightning thrower, Storm Daemon, and steels himself for the fray. There’s nothing else for it – he must hold his ground and make use of the chaos caused by the storm to gain advantage on the battlefield.	true

If everything goes according to his plan, the remaining Skaven host will be driven back and then herded to Gwakmol Crater, where they would be unable to escape their certain fate. Though the Skaven outnumber the Lizardmen many times over, the Prophet’s ever-growing force is empowered by their leader’s undeniable vigour, and they feel assured of victory despite the seemingly insurmountable odds.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_lzd_tehenhauin_plaque_of_sotek_stage_1	The Plaque of Sotek tells of the Prophecy of the Great Serpent-God, whose blessing wards His chosen servants from harm. Only those who have gained Sotek’s favour are granted a blessing such as this, and attaining that favour involves a rite of passage, even for the bearer of the sacred totem of the Serpent-God, the fabled one true Prophet of Sotek, Tehenhauin. Only by following the Prophecy to the letter, exactly as it appears upon this ancient plaque, can its bearer truly understand and harness its awesome power. Tehenhauin, therefore, knows that it was foretold many aeons hence that his pilgrimage would begin in Chaqua, the legendary City of Gold, currently laid low by the vile Skaven of Clan Pestilens…	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_lzd_tehenhauin_plaque_of_sotek_stage_3	The Prophet of Sotek’s following has indeed grown many-fold, for the righteous Lizardmen of Chaqua rallied to his call and to the hallowed word of Sotek himself. At last, the time had come to begin the great migration from Chaqua and take the fight directly to the Skaven’s foul nest-lairs and filthy warrens, for the Serpent-God’s appetite for the right kind of slaughter must be fulfilled before He can return, bringing salvation to the Lizardmen of Lustria.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_lzd_tehenhauin_plaque_of_sotek_stage_2	As is the case for many a great prophet through the centuries, Tehenhauin’s following began as a small but dedicated band, but quickly grew as more and more of the Red Crested Skinks of Chaqua rallied to the hallowed words of the Serpent-God. Now, it appears that the Prophecy is coming true, for there are plagues of heinous ratmen fanning out above and beneath the jungle floor, indicating that the time of the Serpent-God is finally at hand. Upon hearing his pronouncement, hundreds of Skinks rally to the Prophet of Sotek’s noble call to arms.	true

He has an added advantage, however, in that he is technically dead; Kroak’s mortal body was killed during the Great Catastrophe but his remains were preserved by loyal Skink attendants, enabling him to re-emerge as the first Relic Priest.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_great_vortex_tiktaqto_lord_kroak_stage_3	After a considerable amount of searching high and low right across Lustria, Lord Kroak’s Skink scouts finally locate the overgrown temple-tomb in which the ancient Relic Priest is meditating, as ever, upon the fine details of the Great Plan. However, in their haste it would appear that the scouts were somewhat careless, as they have been followed to Kroak’s location by a force of those insidious ratmen, the Skaven!

While they may have put the arcane foundations in place, it is the Great Warding of the Slann - a massive undertaking that keeps most Mage-Priests dormant, such is the concentration needed - that has kept the Vortex functioning.\n\nHowever, since the comet, the Great Warding suffers. Lord Mazdamundi, always the most licentious of Slann, has set about rectifying this by removing the taint of the warmbloods from his realm.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_mazdamundi_cobra_mace_of_mazdamundi_stage_2	The purge goes well, yet warmbloods still dare to desecrate Lustria or is it a Slann Mage-Priest whose interpretations of the Great Plan are heretical? In either case, the interlopers cannot be allowed to live! In Mazdamundi’s anger, he reaches for the Cobra Mace, his own personal relic, and realises for the first time since his awakening that it is not on his bloated person!\n\nOne of his Skink attendants reminds the Slann that the mace was left at the sacred Isle of the Crimson Skull to be recharged amidst its red minerals, which are found nowhere else in the Old World.

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc04_vmp_vlad_von_carstein_the_carstein_ring_stage_1	The Carstein Ring has returned its master to Unlife once more. Vlad, the first Vampire Count, patriarch of the Von Carstein bloodline, is abroad and the world should tremble! However, this resurrection has proven a difficult one. The power of the ring fades, so Vlad must do something about it if he is to use its benighted abilities in future. First there are other priorities; Vlad's absence has been a long one, and his kin have been busy in the intervening centuries. They have been plotting for what Vlad feels is little gain - too interested in their own petty disputes and sibling rivalries. It is time for the first von Carstein to wrest back control from these pretenders!\n\nTo enact his grand plans, Vlad needs a companion, after all where would the Count be without his lady?	true

For this he will need Warpstone, a material craved by other noisome races and Dark Magic-users alike. Vlad is aware of a Warpstone seam deep in the Desolation of Nagash. A chunk of Morrslieb fell from the sky and struck the area many years back, scattering the area in the Chaos-infused rock. Assuming it hasn't already been mined to exhaustion, there will be more than enough for Vlad's needs.\n\nAn expedition across the World's Edge Mountains is needed to collect the Warpstone, one that Vlad plans on leading himself. To bolster this force, he summons his von Carstein sires from the catacombs, those who have been locked and left to rot within their coffins...	true

While the Chaos wastes to the north will always provide the tainted and deranged, the creatures that inhabit the Annulii seem 'purer' and therefore more desirable prey.\n\nSetting foot on Ulthuan is no easy task, the Elf-scum that selfishly live on the island have always gone to great lengths to protect it.

To take that from the world would cause great upset to the Elves.\n\nThe rumour originates from Dark Elf contacts, a merchant on the black market trying to sell a large pinion of the Flamespyre.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_brt_fay_morgianas_mirror	There are thought to have been many Enchantresses through the centuries, and she has certainly gone by many names. And no-one really knows how many ages the current Fay Enchantress, Morgiana, has lived through, but as she travels the land between sacred groves, she draws to her side young children who harbour latent powers inside themselves, most of whom return to serve Bretonnia as Damsels.\n\nIt is fabled that one such girl was favoured above all others by the Lady of the Lake. As the story goes, when Morgiana took her from her parents, the child gifted the Fay Enchantress a most resplendent hand mirror, said to have inexplicable magical properties born of the child’s own power. Such was the potency of the artefact that the Enchantress always took it to the battlefield whenever forced into violent confrontation with her foes.\n\nNow, however, the power of Morgiana’s Mirror has waned. Upon communing with the Lady of the Lake, the Fay Enchantress discovers that the mirror’s power is closely tied to the purity of the Bretonnian soil. With the defiling taint of the many belligerent races of the Old World creeping across the land, the Enchantress’ mission is clear. The only way to restore the mirror to its full potency is to ward away all signs of corruption that may fester across the dukedoms.	true

Something is clearly brewing. Anything that might bring the stunties out from behind the doors of their mountain fastnesses has got to be good news. Grimgor decides to take the uncharacteristically subtle move of cuffing his agent around the head and sending the Goblin sneaking back out to discover more information.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_arkhan_the_staff_of_nagash_stage_1	The Black Pyramid, Nagash's greatest legacy, is a construction of pure, malevolent power. Though eternally loyal to his master, Arkhan would slay a legion to wield even just a little of it. If he can lay his hands on the Staff of Nagash, a fraction will be his to command. No record exists of the staff's whereabouts, but a tool of such arcane eminence does not pass through the world without trace. \n\n Arkhan Summons his agents. He orders them forth to hunt high and low for word of the staff. He bids them be discreet, to cloak their hunt beneath the guise of everyday activity… none must know of Arkhan's the Black's design.	true

The Staff of Nagash is found - in the hands of Settra the Imperishable himself! Arkhan audibly rattles with outrage. How to wrest it from the false king's grasp? He must contrive the most subtle and cunning of plans... as his mind embraces the problem, a course of action presents itself. He will need the assistance of those members of the Mortuary Cult who remain loyal to him... and the very gods themselves. \n\n As he enters the small, incense-wreathed temple of his loyal Mortuary Cultists, Arkhan requests that they construct him a powerful artefact. Silently, he knows they hunger for Canopic Jars to fuel their dark studies, and will gladly work to ensure that more flow their way. When the donkey sees the carrot, it will comply...	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_arkhan_the_staff_of_nagash_stage_3	With his Liche Priests suitably pliant, the second phase of Arkhan's plan may commence. It is somewhat more ambitious: to gain the favour of Tahoth, the ibis-headed God of Knowledge, and plead his assistance with the search. But what manner of feat will turn a god's head? Tapping the Realm of Souls to enliven a great Construct may just do it. Arkhan sets his most capable Liche Priest to a dual task: bring life to stone, while beseeching Tahoth for an audience.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_arkhan_the_staff_of_nagash_stage_4	With a subsonic grind of marble on sandstone, the mighty Warsphinx raises its leonine head: the  beast is quickened. The loyal Liche Priest then shudders violently, his eyelids fluttering in deep agitation. As he stills, the eyes snap open to fix Arkhan with an ageless, scholarly gaze, and an ancient voice issues from his lips "I am here. Who entreats Tahoth, Lord of the Wise?"\n\nElated, Arkhan addresses the god. "It is I, Lord, your servant Arkhan! I ask a boon - I must locate the staff of my master." Tahoth tilts the Priest's head with a painful-sounding rasp of sinew. "Its journey is known to us," the god tells Arkhan. "I grant my knowledge to this vessel. Let it act as your guide. May your quarry serve you well." And with that, the audience is over. Tahoth departs, and the Liche Priest collapses.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_great_vortex_ikit_claw_storm_daemon_mp	Ikit Claw understands very well that direct confrontation with the Lizardmen is not viable, but wiping those tiresome toads from the face of the world always remains a priority, as the Lizardmen plot the demise of all Skaven with equal vigour. In an effort to weaken them before facing them in battle, he set into motion a plan to corrupt their ‘blessed’ spawning pools. Bringing his multifarious capabilities to bear, Ikit used a Warpstone Tractor Beam of his own design to blast the Chaos Moon, raining down fragments to corrupt not just the Lizardmen’s spawning pools themselves, but also the entire surrounding area. The outrageous scheme would deliver the added bonus of supplying Ikit with bountiful deposits of Warpstone to fuel further experiments back at his Forbidden Workshop.\n\nNo plan survives contact with an enemy, however, not even one formulated by the great Ikit Claw, and certainly not when faced with such an advanced foe as the perfidious Lizardmen. Irritatingly, the ever-watchful Slann Astromancers had spotted the falling Warpstone as Ikit approached so are fully battle-ready, and a Skaven scouting party reports that additional Lizardmen reinforcements are already on their way. Collecting some of the pure, fallen Warpstone from the field, Ikit repairs his deadly Warp-lightning thrower, Storm Daemon, and steels himself for the fray. There’s nothing else for it – he must hold his ground and make use of the chaos caused by the storm to gain advantage on the battlefield.	true

Teclis knows Malekith must be stopped. He unsheathes his sword - a weapon forged by himself that has been quiet of late.

If the book was left closed they may have lived, but one of the Man-things opened the Liber Bubonicus and from its pages sprouted a thousand plague-flies.

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_0_stage_4_mpc	With the appearance of giant, winged monsters, Frost-Wyrms are thought to be a type of Chaos-mutated Dragon that dwells in the underground passageways of the Old World’s coldest climes. Amongst the northern tribes there are tales of one such monstrous Frost-Wyrm called Frigustrex, Scion of the Cold-Void, that has terrorised the tundra for centuries. Witnesses say that when coming out of hibernation it emerges from the ground in a heartbeat to indiscriminately devour anything that gets too close to its territory, located somewhere at the frozen northern end of Troll Country.\n\nRecently, the Tower of Khrakk and the Kislevite lands to the south were inexplicably blanketed by freakishly bad snow storms, with entire tribes disappearing from the region without a trace. Witnesses were saying that it was not the icy weather that swallowed their fellow tribesmen up, but a giant Dragonish shadow lurking in the blinding blizzard.\n\nIf there is even the slightest chance that this shadow was the fabled Frigustrex itself, then it is worth investigating further. This could end up being a very bountiful hunt indeed! First you must travel through the Tower of Khrakk and deep into Kislevite lands to find the beast.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_1_stage_5_mpc	The Ruinous Masters have many worshippers across the Old World, amongst which the Beastmen are the most primitive. The influence of Chaos only enhances their bestial aspects, making the already-monstrous beasts larger and even more terrifying than they already are. One such pair of one-eyed abominations of the Beastmen are the gargantuan Cygor brothers known to men as the Salzenmund Soul-Eaters. These grotesque leviathans are not only bigger, stronger, and faster than their ordinary counterparts, but are feared even by Beastmen Bray-Shamans due to their ability to dampen the use of magic for others in their presence. To take on the mighty Soul-Eaters with limited use of magic certainly makes for a challenging hunt, but one which will potentially culminate in an impressive sacrifice to the Gods. First you must find the pair of monsters, who are always found together; a surprisingly difficult task considering their immense size.\n\nYou have consulted one of your Shamans who has a plan which will lead you to your bounty. Having communed with various godlings and daemons in his mysterious rituals, he claims to know the location of the Soul-Eaters, and suggests you march your army to the edge of the Forest of Shadows, taking captive any men you can capture on the way – and keep them alive. This plan is getting interesting...	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_7_stage_3_mpc	Soaring above the eldritch plains of Sylvania there exists flying nocturnal beasts of rotten flesh and withered organs exposed to the night air – the gargantuan bat-like monsters known as Terrorgheists. One such beast known as the Abyssal Shrieker is more terrifying than all others,with a scream that is said to break the will of any man, and eyes like black holes that suck in all magical energies and light. It is an abominable creature spoken about only in nightmarish tales shrouded in myth, the fragments of truth of which are unknown to most.\n\nIn your hunt for the Abyssal Shrieker you obtained a leather-bound notebook containing a written history of the last individual who had attempted to kill it. This long-dead hunter was once a noble of Stirland, which for a time was frequently haunted by the mysterious centuries-old monster, so he set out to kill it himself. According to the notebook, the great Lord failed to slay the beast after a vicious battle, from which he only narrowly escaped with his life. Although he survived the encounter, he paid a terrible price for his defeat. The Terrorgheist absorbed almost all of his lifeforce and strength to make itself even more powerful, leaving the once-great hunter a sickly, weak individual, an affliction suffered by his entire family and bloodline. Withered and disgraced, the noble and his kin exiled themselves to Sylvania where they all eventually perished in shame.\n\nClearly, this pathetic Stirlander was nowhere near as great a hunter as you! He at least managed to record the location of his defeat, which you assume to be in the vicinity of the Abyssal Shrieker’s lair. All that remains to do is travel to Wurtbad to find it.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_6_stage_3_mpc	Mammoths are important tools of war for the northern tribes, and highly valued for sacrifice to the Dark Gods. Lately there have been sightings of some particularly impressive specimens around Norscan regions, rumoured to be members of a legendary herd of behemoths known as the Great Mawherd of Bloodfjord. They are thought to graze on the icy slopes of the Mountains of Hel.\n\nSetting out to hunt the herd down for yourself, you catch wind that rather unusually for Dwarfs, a throng of Slayers and Rangers had also recently been in the Mountains of Hel to hunt the beasts. The Dwarfs’ involvement is interesting, since they are not known to be avid monster hunters, nor are they known to use mammoths in their battle-ranks as the northern tribes do. There must be good a reason for them to have left the safety of their holds just to hunt down some belligerent beasts. They were last seen marching for Kislev, so some further reconnaissance there is needed.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_2_stage_4_mpc	Dragon Ogres are living legends of carnage and destruction. Amongst the more ancient tribes there survives tales of one exceptionally strong Shaggoth known as Traygard Mountain-Cleaver. His power is thought to be second only to Kholek Suneater himself, with the ability to call upon thousands of thunder bolts to rain down on his victims, striking from unpredictable arcs to maim and destroy on his whim. Traygard is indeed an excellent target for a hunt – to sacrifice such a powerful and ancient monster of Chaos would be seen very favourably by the Gods.\n\nHaving heard that Traygard may be active again, you travelled to Goromadny Mountains to follow an interesting lead. A slave languishing in a thrall pen there was allegedly mumbling stories about a ruthless and powerful Shaggoth with frightening power who destroyed his former tribe and its stronghold. Although clearly gone insane, the pitiful man had obviously experienced a terrible encounter in battle, missing an eye and an arm. Upon speaking to him yourself, he revealed to you that he is actually a former Marauder Champion whose tribe was utterly devastated by the abominable Shaggoth they know was Traygard Mountain-Cleaver. A single blow from the great monster had caused him to lose his arm, then he was struck by one of the many bolts of lightning falling from the sky, which grazed the side of his head and burnt one of his eyes out.\n\nThe legendary beast must exist, for the proof of it stands right there in front of you. But now you must see for yourself. The slave gives you the likely location of where the beast was headed after obliterating his tribe – the Chaos Wastes.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_5_stage_3_mpc	Forest Dragons are truly remarkable creatures, dominating the forests as all Dragons dominate their habitats. For most, stepping into the woods to find one to slay is either an act of extreme bravery or hopeless stupidity, such is the fiercely protective nature of the beings who dwell there. To some, the Wood Elves are as dangerous as the unpredictable Beastmen, both of whom may attack unprovoked if you trespass into their woodland territories.\n\nSomewhere in the trees and thickets of Athel Loren lives the Forest Dragon known as Radixashen, Serpent of the Worldroots. It is thought to be as ancient as the forest itself, and for that, it is a highly prized bounty for sacrifice. As with all Dragons, however, it is very elusive. Striding blindly into the forest to find it would be foolish and futile – the best course of action would be to make the beast come to you.\n\nKnowing Radixashen to be one of the great protectors of the Elves’ forest, you can think of one target that will surely draw the Dragon out. The great tree known as the Oak of Ages, which is not only considered the source of the forest’s power, is also the annual birthplace of the Elven King in the Woods. Surely, the Serpent of the Worldroots will not be able to ignore the desecration of such a revered and important location. It is time to raise the raiding banners!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_3_stage_3_mpc	Recently, harrowing stories had started circulating that gigantic Venom Queens were grouping into vast spider swarms in the lands to the south. The most recent spate of appearances had been in the area around Karak Eight Peaks, where they had taken over swathes of land, devouring all who came near. Your spies tell you that this is undoubtedly the work of Skarsnik, the self-proclaimed ‘Warlord of Eight Peaks’, who had allegedly discovered the group of larger, poisonous Arachnaroks, and had been trying to herd them into the area for use in his own malevolent schemes.\n\nYou care not for some stupid Goblin’s ill-conceived plans, but the news of this bounty can only mean one thing to a Norscan hunter – a prime opportunity for a worthy sacrifice!

It seems that the Dwarfs have got wind of a Chaos Warband returning from the Dark Lands to the East where they have collected a consignment of equipment from the wicked Chaos Dwarfs.

Frothing at the mouth in both anger and excitement, Throgg sputters a war cry at his horde to move out, and swiftly. He will eat this thief slowly and painfully, piece by piece, and take back what is rightfully his!\n\nAs they catch up to the convoy, Throgg sees that the Dwarfs have not been caught off-guard and are expecting him, so an ambush is not possible. They have already taken up a defensive position at a small chokepoint in the road. Best be quick – this is Dwarf heartland after all.	true

The Troll King was glad to satisfy his hunger for man-flesh, which he did several times over. But still his prized crown eluded him.\n\nAs he contented himself in the gleeful dismemberment of captured soldiers to snack on later, one of the doomed individuals begging for his life tells him of a vast Dwarf convoy travelling from Karak Kadrin that had been seen on the move nearby. It was allegedly carrying with it great riches, but more interestingly, in the convoy’s ranks was a particular Runelord known to be an infamous hoarder of treasures. Undoubtedly, this convoy was as good a place as any for Throgg to continue the search for his crown.\n\nThrogg gobbles the informant up whole and spits out his bones before calling on his force to march on Peak Pass.

Very few men have faced him and not ended up as one of his meals, but now Throgg can show the rest of their frail race that Wintertooth is not just a myth witnessed by foolish dead heroes! Throgg chuckles to himself – he is looking forward to ruling over the man-cattle of the Empire, and surely these cowards were the ones who had taken his crown, or at least knew who did. He will bring a blizzard of death and destruction to the very hearts of their villages and towns, leaving no stone unturned in search of his prize!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_throgg_wintertooth_crown_stage_2	At last, the Plunder Hall is complete! Immediately, Throgg feels the stirring of his subjects all across the frozen northern lands and the anticipation of the despoilment to come, all of which was making him salivate with near-crazed excitement. But still, something is missing. The Troll King’s army is still without the most feared of all Troll-kind – the Norscan Ice Trolls, whose foul, icy breath causes all before them to freeze dead in their tracks before being eaten.\n\nWith his army poised to head south, Throgg is unlikely to find any Ice Trolls to recruit once they are on the march. If he is to cause maximum terror while on the search for his crown, Throgg must have them in his army ranks before setting off.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_throgg_wintertooth_crown_stage_1	Throgg is no ordinary Troll. Although as physically brutish and savage as all other Trolls, his mutations have also gifted him a grim and malevolent cunning, making him widely feared as an ambushing killer of ruthless precision. Proclaiming himself a ‘Lord of all Trolls and Monsters’, the greatest of Heroes regularly ride northwards to attempt to slay him. And every season, the Troll King dines on their flesh.\n\nHaving just defeated and devoured his last unfortunate challenger, Throgg stares down at the broken bodies of his half-eaten meals. As he rubs the top of his malformed head he becomes infuriated, remembering that he had been missing his prized Wintertooth Crown for far too long now. It was stolen from right under his nose many moons ago, and Throgg wants it back. It is a powerful and valuable artefact but more importantly, when he finally brings about his plan of a new ice age and enslaves all the races of the world, it will symbolise his position as more than just the Troll King – but as an overlord to all! Throgg decides to head southward to find and reclaim what is rightfully his, intent on killing anything that dares to get in his way. After all, if the realms of civilisation were so keen to fight him and his bestial subjects, then he would happily oblige, with all the monsters of Troll Country at his side!\n\nBefore Throgg can start the search for his crown he must order the building of a new Plunder Hall to bestir the raiding desires of his accompanying minions: the stinking beasts, drooling mutants, and tormented madmen who will help him pillage the southern lands as he searches for his crown and fulfils his plans of domination.	true

Be that as it may, the Southlands jungles are vast and immense, and searching through the dense jungle canopy is no easy feat, even for the most experienced aerial combatant among the Lizardmen.

Whether intentionally or not, the foul rat-spawn must have desecrated the lost temple ruins in this place, probably whilst searching for their damnable Warpstone deposits – only something like that could’ve caused such local disruption to the Web, in turn explaining the weakening of the blessings upon Tiktaq’to’s Mask of Heavens.

To best aid the Dawi of Kraka Drak, Grombrindal must first gain their trust. 	true
missions_localised_description_wh_pro01_dwf_grombrindal_rune_axe_of_grombrindal_stage_1	The Norse Dwarfs of Kraka Drak are in peril and Grombrindal feels their need, as he does the needs of all Dawi. Eschewing his favoured method of travelling incognito, the White Dwarf gathers a throng and heads north to help his Norse kin, even as Great King Thorgard Cromson seals the Hold and prepares for war.\n\nThe White Dwarf despises urks, but reserves a special hatred for the forces of Chaos, for it was the Ruinous Powers that took his kin and liege, Grimnir, away. The revered Ancestor was last seen millennia ago wandering into the Chaos Wastes. Before marching north, Grombrindal sets his Rune Axe on an Oath Stone and pledges to slay many servants of the Dark Gods on this latest of great labours. Only when the tally has been reached will the runes in the mighty axe-head glow once more. The White Dwarf sets about this task immediately by hunting down and slaying as many of the Chaos filth as he can find.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_4	After looting countless settlements and torturing thousands of unfortunate victims, Luthor and his pirate horde come across a shackled slave who claims to have been a former soldier of the Empire. He tells Luthor that he had recently been part of an expeditionary force that found a chest of embossed Slann Gold, but on their way back to camp they were ambushed by a vast Lizardmen army, the largest he had ever seen. The soldier narrowly escaped with his life, but everyone in his troop was slaughtered and the Lizardmen made off back to Lustria with their gold.\n\nClearly this hoard is of great importance to the Lizardmen for them to have brought such a force to take it back – there must be more to this gold than its monetary value alone. Luthor can see his goal clearly now, his mind yearning to be repaired. He needs to gather his minions, return to Lustria, and attack these cold-blooded freaks!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_3	Having ordered his Undead crewmen to leave no stone unturned, it seems that the ruins do not contain the artefacts Luthor seeks. His Zombie Deckhands manage to capture a small, reptile-like creature hiding amongst the rubble, which they drag hissing and writhing before him. Gathering himself for a moment, Luthor recognises it as a Skink – a smaller species of Lizardman, typically more mentally agile than others in their cold-blooded ranks. Surely this peon knows how to get his hands on what Luthor seeks?\n\nHe demands that the location of any nearby enchanted Slann Gold be revealed, but is brazenly ignored. This lizard-minion obviously does not know who it is dealing with – patience and rationality are not qualities present in any of his fractured personalities. In an instant, Luthor is pressing his pistol against the Skink’s head, muttering lunacies and cocking the hammer. The startled prisoner immediately starts blurts out something about a chest of glyph-embossed medallions buried underneath the very ruins in which they stand. The Skink claims they had previously belonged to the great Mage-Priest Mazdamundi himself, but had been stolen by one of several expeditions that had recently passed through the region.\n\nLuthor turns away to ponder, leaving the Lizardman to his starved Scurvy Dogs. The chest of Slann Gold could be anywhere by now, and finding it will not be simple. Luthor flies into a sudden rage, growling to his crew to prepare for a long campaign of despoilment. He will sack cities near and far in his search, caring not for the wars he might start!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_2	With control over his Undead crew better asserted, Luthor decides to step up his efforts to repair his damaged psyche. He does not know for sure, but thinks it likely that the glyphs which drained his powers and shattered his mind all those years ago were of Slann origin. In a moment of manic realisation, Luthor concludes that the best chance he has to undo his impairments is to find powerful artefacts from the same source.\n\nThe Slann – a powerful species of Lizardmen with an unparalleled mastery over the Sorcerous arts – are known to use many enchanted totems and trinkets of gold to serve their indecipherable purposes. The best chance of finding one is to search the most ancient ruins of the long-abandoned cities and towns of Lustria and beyond, where the Slann are most likely to have left their mark. It may be a long shot, but one that Luthor is desperate enough to take.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_1	Luthor Harkon has been looking for a way to restore his connection to the Winds of Magic for decades. Many years ago he disturbed an ancient chamber sealed with some powerful glyphs, which retaliated by draining away his powers. In addition to losing his spellcasting abilities, his mind was shattered into a dozen different facets which left him teetering on the brink of insanity.\n\nWell aware of his mental instabilities, Luthor realises he can no longer risk losing control at a crucial moment, for if a weaker personality were to take over during a fight it could mean the difference between victory and defeat. At the very worst, such a situation could be his very undoing. He decides he needs a capable first mate to take command of his Undead crewmen should he falter at an inconvenient time.	true

For millennia, the Asur have arrogantly believed it is their magic that has sustained the Vortex. While they may have put the arcane foundations in place, it is the Great Warding of the Slann - a massive undertaking that keeps most Mage-Priests dormant, such is the concentration needed - that has kept the Vortex functioning.\n\nHowever, since the comet, the Great Warding suffers. Lord Mazdamundi, always the most licentious of Slann, has set about rectifying this by removing the taint of the warmbloods from his realm.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_lzd_mazdamundi_cobra_mace_of_mazdamundi_stage_3	With his realm purged, Lord Mazdamundi makes haste for the Isle of the Crimson Skull to collect the Cobra Mace, for he will need it during his labours to come. They arrive upon the beach to see that the foulest of all warmbloods, the Skaven, have scoured the island, attracted by the crimson rocks. It may not be Warpstone, but even so, the ratmen recognise the value it holds.\n\nLord Mazdamundi is outraged and immediately orders their utter extinction!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_lzd_mazdamundi_cobra_mace_of_mazdamundi_stage_2	The purge goes well, yet warmbloods still dare to desecrate Lustria or is it a Slann Mage-Priest whose interpretations of the Great Plan are heretical? In either case, the interlopers cannot be allowed to live! In Mazdamundi’s anger, he reaches for the Cobra Mace, his own personal relic, and realises for the first time since his awakening that it is not on his bloated person!\n\nOne of his Skink attendants reminds the Slann that the mace was left at the sacred Isle of the Crimson Skull to be recharged amidst its red minerals, which are found nowhere else in the Old World. Mazdamundi orders that they collect the relic, but only after the enemy settlement is taken or destroyed.	true

He even sends out scouts ahead so that he can pick the best targets for his horde, rather than just smashing anything they come across - something he calls "strategy" apparently.

While Tyrion impatiently waits within while Vaul's smiths reknit the armour, he is called to the shrine’s entrance. Druchii gather! They certainly knew of Tyrion’s whereabouts, perhaps the armour’s failing was a trap after all? Tyrion prepares his host for war; he will face the hated foe without his usual protection, although he does not need it, for he is Ulthuan’s Defender!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_tyrion_dragon_armour_of_aenarion_stage_3	Now is the time for Tyrion to prove worthy of the title ‘Defender’. After sowing disquiet across the inner and outer kingdoms, the enemy finally makes its move; however, Tyrion is there to strike back! With the Everqueen’s blessing, he rides forth, to bring ruin on the trespassers. Unfortunately the Dragon Armour of Aenarion is damaged in the onslaught. A lucky strike perhaps? Or something more contrived? In any event, the armour must be returned to where it was forged for repair.	true

Tyrion’s presence is a small comfort, but the Asur have always been highly attuned to the magical eddies that assail the world. And all - from Swordmaster to poet to humble cordwainer - feel the doom encroach as the Vortex fails.\n\nAmidst this unease, the rumours of Dark Elves hidden amongst the populace persists, and that an assassination attempt on the Phoenix King and his foremost champions is imminent. It is fortunate that the world’s best bodyguards reside on Ulthuan - in Chrace to be specific.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_tyrion_dragon_armour_of_aenarion_stage_1	Ever since the two-tailed Dragon was seen burning across the sky the world has become even more of an uncertain place. The Vortex grows more unstable, and the enemies of the Asur seek to take advantage. Unsurprisingly, it is the Druchii that are most aggressive. Reports of coastal raids are flooding into Lothern and even that the Witch King is now abroad. Fear spreads that Dark Elves land upon Ulthuan and are trying inveigle themselves into the populace - ready to pounce upon neighbours when bidden by Malekith.\n\nFinubar calls his unofficial war council of which Tyrion is the central pillar.

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_grn_wurrzag_da_great_green_prophet_baleful_mask_stage_1	The Badlands have always been, well… bad. In the past, it was a realm of several dark and doomed empires, but now it is an arid backwater dominated by the Greenskins. The Orcs and Goblins thrive in this forsaken place. It was the birthplace of many a Waaagh! that has gone on to devastate Dwarf and humie kingdoms alike. While a Waaagh! can occur ‘naturally’ sometimes these things need a catalyst. For years, that catalyst has been Wurrzag, 'Da Great Green Prophet'. \n\nHowever, word has reached the Savage Orc Shaman that some gobbo in the south is claiming to be the new prophet, denouncing Wurrzag as an "air-a-tick" and "pretenda"! Now that is fightin’ talk! Wurrzag immediately gathers loyal believers around him to put down this false prophet and prove he is the one and only true voice of da Green Godz!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_grn_wurrzag_da_great_green_prophet_baleful_mask_stage_2	The false prophet is intimidated by Wurrzag's support, but the crafty little git is not defeated yet. One of his followers is sent to slay Wurrzag, but you don’t get to be Mork and Gork’s best mate if you could be so easily shiv'd! Wurrzag foils the attack with ease but the minion makes a decent run for it before he can be severely slapp’d.\n\nHowever, it turns out the would-be killer was merely a diversion! While the Shaman was dealing with the assassin, his mask - the one with the baleful glare, an important part of his mantle as da Great Green Prophet - is stolen. There can only be one culprit - this infuriating Gobbo with delusions of grandeur. The mask and its thief must be found at all costs!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_grn_wurrzag_da_great_green_prophet_baleful_mask_stage_3	The Savage Orc Shaman’s forces rage across the land. But the false prophet has gone to ground, along with Wurrzag's mask. However, Da Great Green Prophet is not out of options just yet; someone knows where the Goblin is hiding and if piety to da 'tru' prophet doesn’t motivate them to talk, then some teef or a few shiny trinkets put in an Orc’s hand should do the job. Of course, there are other ways too, but Wurrzag thinks it best to try the carrot before he gets out the stick or, in his case, the extra pointy stabba!	true

Dire storm clouds gather around the peaks and crags where the Mountain God is said to slumber, yet Suneater is not fully awake. Before a great chasm that splits the mountains like a gigantic axe wound, hundreds upon hundreds of Northmen kneel in the pelting hail and snow, chanting sonorously as tribute after screaming tribute is hurled bodily down into the cavernous lair.

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_grn_wurrzag_da_great_green_prophet_baleful_mask_stage_2.1	The false prophet is intimidated by Wurrzag's support, but the crafty little git is not defeated yet. One of his followers is sent to slay Wurrzag, but you don’t get to be Mork and Gork’s best mate if you could be so easily shiv'd! Wurrzag foils the attack with ease but the minion makes a decent run for it before he can be severely slapp’d.\n\nHowever, it turns out the would-be killer was merely a diversion! While the Shaman was dealing with the assassin, his mask - the one with the baleful glare, an important part of his mantle as da Great Green Prophet - is stolen. There can only be one culprit - this infuriating gobbo with delusions of grandeur. The mask and its thief must be found at all costs! This is a difficult task, since the Greenskin tribes have been scattered, yet if Wurrzag can control the swathes of the Badlands, he'll be able to find the mask and set about reassembling the Waaagh!, as after all that is what Gork and Mork put him on this world to do.	true

His fearsome reputation has gathered many Greenskin tribes behind him in a Waaagh! which is now headed for the main route from the Badlands into the Empire: Black Fire Pass.

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc05_qb_bst_morghur_stave_of_ruinous_corruption_stage_1	Wherever Morghur treads, Chaos follows with him. A dark tide of ravening madness and mutagenic power swirls around Morghur, corrupting and changing all those around him - friend and foe alike. This power, however, is beyond the control of Morghur even - to contain the swirling essence of Chaos that trails the Master of Skulls is beyond the capability of any mortal container. For this essence to be caught, and harnessed, something more... immortal is required. Such vessels are not made easily; they require macabre and difficult to obtain materials, but needs must.\n\nYou must start with the spines of the Orcs.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc05_qb_bst_morghur_stave_of_ruinous_corruption_stage_3	The Dwarfen skulls are of great importance to the ritual. Yet thick and hardy as they are, the innate Dwarfen inability to channel the Winds of Magic leaves them at a significant disadvantage. The leaves rustle and the trees themselves seem to shiver as Morghur unveils the final part of his plan: the Wood Elves. The Asrai and their forests are steeped in magic, old as the world itself. A Waystone, thieved from deep within the sanctuary forests of Athel Loren, will be more than sufficient to sate Morghur's desires. Let none of the Elves or Treekin stand in your way - cut them down in the name of this quest!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc05_qb_bst_morghur_stave_of_ruinous_corruption_stage_2	Defeating the Greenskins was not the difficult part - that was removing the spine in one piece from their bodies.

Their stern and thick craniums will be the next important part of the ritual. As many as can be obtained must be, and as fast as possible!	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_brt_alberic_braid_of_bordeleaux	Bordeleaux is a dukedom with long-standing maritime traditions, the inhabitants of its long coastline having had a strong relationship with the ocean by virtue of drawing much of their livelihood and sustenance from it. But across the oceans of the Old World and beyond, trouble brews. Seaborne bandits ply the straits in their ships of war, preying on those foolish enough to sail unsuitably prepared to defend their cargo from those with no qualms about taking it with deadly force. Sometimes it is not even wealth that the bloodthirsty pirates desire, with many murderous, Undead commanders simply hellbent on acquiring yet more dead bodies to raise into their zombie pirate crews.\n\nThe seafaring Bordelens are well-accustomed to having to deal with pirates, which is why Duke Alberic found it unusual that he was recently visited by several nobles from the coastal fiefdoms complaining that entire fishing fleets operating out of their estates had gone missing with increasing frequency. Renowned for his personal courage and astounding self-discipline, the duke refuses to stand by and allow his people’s livelihoods to be put at risk without taking action.\n\nThere is no better place for Alberic to begin his expedition to cleanse the oceans than Sartosa, the City of Pirates, which lies to the south on the other side of the Estalian Peninsula. Though the infamous thief-ridden port is thought to currently be under the control of the bloodthirsty sea captain Aranessa Saltspite, Alberic knows that the inherent backstabbing nature of pirates means that any number of belligerent enemies could be encountered there. He therefore scrambles his attendants to prepare for departure. Finally, he has a purpose – this may not be a Grail Quest, but it is still worthy of the aging duke’s attention.	true

But Queek waves the coward away - after all, he is Queek Headtaker, what could go wrong? A messenger intercepted in an off-shoot tunnel is captured, on his way to report to the Grand Warlord himself - this was nothing but a ruse by Gnawdwell himself to keep Queek on his toes!

Killing his loyal followers is not enough to sate the Headtaker’s rage, so he lashes out at the closest enemies, for they are clearly the thieves… in some way.

For a moment, Queek is tempted to rip out the messenger’s throat at this news, but realises that if he keeps killing his loyal servants he’ll run out of followers. Instead, Queek settles for a swipe with his claw, sending the inferior flying, before rearing to his full height and demanding the perpetrator must be found.

Queek’s whiskers twitch in appreciation at the ego-boosting address, but otherwise he remains silent and still. "The assassin-thief has deliberately fled in Dwarf territory. I suspect a trap."\n\nQueek rises to his full height in triumph.\n\n"I knew it! Beard-things!", he says with glee.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_mortal_empires_tmb_khalida_venom_staff_stage_2	Khalida arranges herself in the restored temple, and the priestesses begin their invocations. As the chant rises, Khalida begins to feel the venom quickening within her. Opening her mind in supplication to the goddess, she hears  Asaph's familiar voice whisper to her "Khalida, my chosen. You feel my blessing once more. But it is weakened, for there is foul work afoot. The cursed Lahmians meddle once more... they sully my sacred ground. Locate my shrine at the Springs of Eternal Life.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_mortal_empires_tmb_khalida_venom_staff_stage_3	When Khalida enters Asaph's shrine, a scene of desecration greets her. Thousands of snake-bones litter the cave floor and the springwater is befouled by necromancy. The source of the corruption, a black orb, lies upon the altar of Asaph. Enraged, Khalida bellows in fury and shatters the artefact, then curtly orders her priestesses to prepare a rite of purification. As their intonations fill the caverns, the corrupted waters turn pure again, and serpents emerge from crevices to form a writhing carpet. Khalida hears the voice of Asaph, stronger now "The beauty of my shrines is restored, but vengeance is yet unanswered. You will find our enemies on the river turned to ash. Destroy them in my name!" Emerging from the cavern, Khalida orders her forces to march tirelessly for Ash River. The spawn of Neferata will be undone!	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_mortal_empires_tmb_khalida_venom_staff_stage_1	The blessing of Asaph, the Asp-Goddess, has waned of late. The divine venom in Khalida’s veins flows sluggishly, and her Venom Staff seems devoid of the goddess' fury. Deeply concerned by this, she summons her priestesses for counsel. After much deliberation, they propose a ritual to invoke the Asp-Goddess and awaken her blessing once more. The incantations cannot be performed without due honours, however. To provide a fitting stage for the ceremony, the Temple of Asaph must be restored to its former glory.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_hef_tyrion_sunfang_stage_1	Tyrion, son of Arathion, is the greatest warrior in Ulthuan - some say the greatest warrior to have ever lived upon the Elven island. For an Elf, he is a being of simple tastes, and a rare straight-talker who despises dressing up his words in needless confections and double-meanings - unlike the princes that frequent the court of the Phoenix Throne.\n\nIn Tyrion’s mind it is these dandy fools that will be their race’s undoing; while they prance about court furthering their own agendas, the Vortex struggles, and invasion is imminent. Tyrion quits the court in disgust and goes about mustering a force to repel the inevitable.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_hef_tyrion_sunfang_stage_2	The Elven lust for intrigue can be insatiable… and often self-destructive. A certain cohort of princes, envious of Tyrion’s influence over King Finubar, seeks to exploit the situation of the failing Vortex and Teclis’ sudden departure to Lustria for his own gain. The jealous princes utter a poisonous rumour in court and let's their race's proclivity for scandal do the rest... \n\nTyrion’s pride burns as deeply as any Dwarf’s, and that can make him predictable. The veiled insult eats at Tyrion - the claim that he is only so renowned because of the sword he wields has him cast it aside to prove it is not so. Yet such rumours have a tendency to grow like a spider's web, catching larger flies. Soon the talk of the courts is that Tyrion is no campaigner. While those in battle may fear the Defender of Ulthuan - on grander strategies, such as depriving the foe of hideaways or destroying enemy supply routes, Tyrion is clueless - or so the rumours asserted. Tyrion could ignore such bunkum, but his pride prevents him. He shall prove the naysayers wrong!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_hef_tyrion_sunfang_stage_3	Tyrion has proven himself more than a mere warrior, but a capable general and leader of the Asur! Back in court, the conniving princes hide their victorious smiles, Tyrion has played into their hands. The princes whisper to others that the so-called Defender of Ulthuan has grown out of control, that he should be ostracised from Finubar’s warrior council. They say this all while sipping the finest wine from silver chalices, and secretly agree to reconvene in Saphery.\n\nOf course, even as these nobles bask in their self-congratulatory hubris, they forget that while Tyrion is no politician he is certainly no puppet either. It will soon be time to teach these fools a lesson in manners and he will not need Sunfang to do so!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_hef_tyrion_sunfang_stage_4	The conspiracy is traced to Saphery, where the princes' lies have spread to the Loremasters. While Tyrion simply tries to hunt down and face his accusers, he finds an aggressive battle line in the lee of the White Tower, for the mages of Hoeth have ever been Teclis' people. The princes would have that Tyrion’s recent actions prove that he is not the honourable Defender of Ulthuan but a Druchii sympathiser - a weakness of his lineage! Battle is inevitable...	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_dwf_belegar_ironhammer_shield_of_defiance_stage_2a_mpc	Belegar's champion returns with a trove of information. An Orc Warboss had taken Dawi he had found imprisoned deep under Black Crag and all but forgotten by their jailer, Gorfang Rotgut. The Warboss stole away the Dwarfs and, under enslavement, forced them to dig new passages within the Underway, secret to all but his own rabble of filthy Orcs.\n\nBelegar is outraged! He at once recognises the captive Dawi as kin - fine folk taken from Karak Azul in a raid years past. This is a fell deed that demands vengeance! However, Ironhammer knows it is not a grudge he can right on its own; King Kazador of Karak Azul still broods on this outrage and so must be informed at once. Dwarf tradition states that news of such great import be given with a surety - a bond between kings - so that no Dawi could doubt its severity. Belegar doesn't hesitate and sends his shield as his oath.	true

He has an added advantage, however, in that he is technically dead; Kroak’s mortal body was killed during the Great Catastrophe but his remains were preserved by loyal Skink attendants, enabling him to re-emerge as the first Relic Priest. Due to his death, Kroak’s meditative cycles are significantly longer than those of younger Slann.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_great_vortex_kroqgar_lord_kroak_stage_2	Unfortunately, it appears that the Lord Kroak was roused from his slumber far too early; not enough time had passed since his previous awakening, so he remains in a semi-dream state.

However, in their haste it would appear that the scouts were somewhat careless, as they have been followed to Kroak’s location by a force of those insidious ratmen, the Skaven! They plan to destroy him, once and for all, by incinerating his physical remains that anchor him to the world. This must not come to pass – defend Kroak from harm whilst his priests awaken him!	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_objective_harkon_01	Luthor Harkon has been battling with himself for some time, his fractured mind recently causing him to lose grip on his Undead pirate empire. Mutineers have emerged, insolently stealing part of his land named for his exploits. The fog of his mind lifts just enough for Luthor to unite his wills – it is time for the Pirate King to raid the hovels of any nearby landlubbers, murdering all before him on his way to regaining supremacy.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_objective_harkon_02	Harkon has re-established some control over both his mind and his lands; now, the time has come to use this momentum to try and repair his psyche once and for all.

Yet Luthor’s personalities still bicker over his goals, with some wanting to restore his mind and destroy the Slann responsible for breaking it, while others simply lusting after territory and plunder. Luthor can only try and steer himself towards the Lizardmen, but beyond the Vampire Coast there are plenty of other targets out there.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_objective_harkon_04	His mind may not be fully healed yet, but his psyche has become slightly more controllable, his strength at levels never achieved before, and his ambition only growing with every victory.

A sharp blast will dispel the magical residue left behind by Morghur's minions and reveal the path back to his location. Orion is overjoyed, the burning desire for vengeance bubbling up in him as the moment of justice grows nearer.

Lokhir’s continued expansion overseas shall serve to reinforce that!	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_hef_teclis_war_crown_of_saphery_stage_1	The War Crown is seldom seen outside the walls of the White Tower. Even Teclis himself wears it only in times of great need, so he sets off to Lustria without it. However, it quickly becomes apparent that circumstances are direr than even the High Loremaster realised, and so he sends for the crown. A pair of Great Eagles are dispatched from Saphery with the crown securely held their claws. An epic journey follows, crossing the Great Ocean and then the continent itself.\n\n Perhaps it was inevitable, on a flight that long, that the Eagles would not reach Teclis. Something has gone wrong - the crown and its winged escort are lost. An artefact of such power and reverence cannot be allowed to simply vanish. Teclis knows of a ritual of Isha that should be invoked, for a mother always knows where her children lie, and the War Crown is of Isha's making.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_hef_teclis_war_crown_of_saphery_stage_3	The location is revealed. Isha’s light guides Teclis and his Sapherian host to a dark, dank cavern in the north of mountain chain. On entering the cave, the High Elves are assaulted by a unholy stench. Some turn their noses up and even consider returning to the surface, but Teclis gives them a stern look and bids they advance further into the depths.\n\nA piercing scream echoes through the cavern; the master of the lair is in residence! Bones drop from the ceiling to come crashing amidst the High Elven host. The carcasses of two Eagles litter the cavern floor. Teclis looks up to see the hunter that ripped them from the sky - a gigantic Undead bat…\n\nBut even this beast does not seem to be alone, for in the shadows, scuttling all around the periphery of the cave, the Elves hear mocking chitters!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_hef_teclis_war_crown_of_saphery_stage_2	The ritual grants Teclis knowledge, but not the whole answer. He knows that the Eagles were brought down deliberately, somewhere over the Spine of Sotek. Yet that mountain chain is vast; Isha’s influence will have to be cast across Lustria for the Crown to quickly make itself known.	true

Yet what man or woman fortunate enough to behold the scion of Slaanesh can help but harbour a kernel of envy at his cruel perfection? Flanked by scores of devoted admirers wherever he goes, a callous and deadly Lord of battle, and spoiled by his indulgent adoptive father Slaanesh, the Geld-Prince’s every wildly-excessive wish is made manifest. But such renown has its price. The Champions of Chaos are forever searching for more power, and with it, the chance to attract the eye of the Gods themselves. They are constantly hunting out rivals and great duels are fought, with the victor winning further infamy and power. Now a Chaos Lord rival challenges Prince Sigvald the Magnificent, driven by envy and a lust for power, and with an army of hideous beasts repellent to the Geld-Prince.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_main_vmp_mannfred_von_carstein_armour_of_templehof_stage_4	With the Savage Orcs routed, Count Mannfred draws upon his dark arts, dragging the reluctant spirit of the dead Nehekharan king back to the surface. It seems that the king’s army was scattered by a sudden sandstorm, and slain by a horde of Greenskins. The Greenskin Warboss, Grudsnik, stripped the king's corpse of the magnificent armour. The spirit knows no more, and Count Mannfred releases it. The name of Grudsnik is known to the Vampire Lord. Grudsnik da Magnificent was once the scourge of Bretonnia. Such was his reputation that his followers built a great burial mound for him protected by Shamanic fetishes. Such wards are of little concern to Mannfred, and he now sends the Necromancer west to scout out the area.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_main_vmp_mannfred_von_carstein_armour_of_templehof_stage_1	While the first Vampire Count, Vlad von Carstein, was the most physically powerful of the Vampire Counts, Mannfred was far more cunning. And when Vlad was slain during the climactic battle of the Vampire Wars, Mannfred did not involve himself in the infighting that followed. Instead, he travelled far and wide, seeking to deepen his knowledge of Necromantic lore and dark artefacts. Now that Mannfred has returned to Sylvania, he is more powerful than ever. Having asserted his dominance, he makes preparations to unearth some of the evil relics that his studies hinted at.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_main_vmp_mannfred_von_carstein_armour_of_templehof_stage_2	During his studies amongst the bone-dry papyrus and scrolls made of skin in the ancient city of Lahmia, Count Mannfred uncovered several references to a suit of mail imbued with great power. In ages past, the armour’s original owner, a king of Nehekhara, fell in battle somewhere in the southern Badlands - beyond this the armour passes from the record. The Count summons a Necromancer. Though quite mad, the man is adept at rooting out forbidden knowledge, like all those of his benighted kind. He should prove ideal for the task of seeking out any traces of the lost king.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc04_vmp_helman_ghorst_liber_noctus_stage_2_2	Helman Ghorst is on the hunt. The Necromancer is desperate to reunite all the pages of the Liber Noctus - a book that contains even more powerful enchantments than those written in its sister tome, the Liber Necronomica.\n\nThere are whispers that one of the missing pages has been framed and hung up in a tavern, the ignorant peasantry believing it to be some generations-old proclamation from an Arch Lector. What fools! The location of the tavern has been narrowed to the province of Reikland. Ghorst must find the page and punish these mortals for their ignorance!  	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc04_vmp_helman_ghorst_liber_noctus_stage_4_2	In exchange for spores of the Blue Rose Plague, the Vampire bequeaths Ghorst some pertinent information. The Cult of Sigmar have caught wind of Ghorst's search as, after all, the Necromancer wasn't very subtle in burning down Empire settlements. The Sigmarites are now searching for the last remaining pages to keep them out of Ghorst's, and ultimately Mannfred's, hands. They have tracked the pages to a site deep within the Border Princes - taken there by a Lahmian cult centuries ago, placed in a sealed casket and thrown in a deep gorge to keep them out of Nagash's necrotic hands. Burning the pages would have proved more effective, but many counter-curses ensure the Books of Nagash cannot be so easily destroyed.\n\nAnd so the Cult of Sigmar control the site, hunting for the casket. Ghorst needs the location. The Vampire gives him a redolent smile, stating that while the whereabouts remain a mystery to her, she is aware of a being that does know. Getting the information from such a creature should not be too taxing, as will killing it afterwards to ensure its silence.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_orion_horn_of_the_wild_stage_2	With the perimeters of the forest secured, a relative sense of normality is restored to the forest. However, foulness still lurks beneath the trees, and Orion will see the source of it uncovered and eliminated. Reports reach the king that a herd of Beastmen, using the confusion sown by the attacks, slipped through the perimeter and defiled another Waystone. Before he could intercept them, however, they used their hidden beast-paths to slink back into the undergrowth and, with all the subtlety they could muster, out of sight. However, Orion and his scouts detected the foul and pestilent aura of Dark Magic at the site of the Beastman raid - an aura that could belong to only one Beastman that Orion knows of: Morghur. As ill an omen as it is that the Master of Skulls is abroad, the lingering magical detritus provides an opportunity. If it can be analysed then it can be traced, and the enemies of the Elves can be brought to justice. To do this, however, the Spellsingers must be consulted...	true

Although Orion sped there with the wind at his back he found no evidence of who or what was responsible. Although the desire for revenge runs deep, he knows there can be no offensive against his enemies whilst Athel Loren lies vulnerable; the defences must be rebuilt before any vengeance can be taken.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_monster_hunt_10_stage_4_mpc	There is a legend known to the sentinels in the watchtowers far to the north of Naggaroth which tells of a great War Hydra known as the Beast of Raema. It is the perfect quarry, never aging but simply getting larger and its scales denser as the years go by. Having received word that the watchtower of Dargoth had recently been attacked by a raging multi-headed beast, you headed toward the Land of Chill to investigate.\n\nYou arrived at the watchtower in the aftermath of the attack, the tower itself still aflame, with bodies of the recently-mauled littering the area. Given the scale of the devastation, there could be no doubt that the gigantic War Hydra that you hunt was the creature that attacked it. Furthermore, it also came to light that the creature is not alone. It is accompanied by Beastmen, who are worshipping it as a deity. By all accounts, these Gors are even more rabid than their usual cloven kin. It matters not - if they get between you and your prey then they will become trophies as well!\n\nAs you follow the trail, your scouts report back that the beast has struck again!

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_monster_hunt_11_stage_3_mpc	While dancing in the Warpstone vapours and flames of the camp's fire, your Shaman claimed to have been given instructions from the Dark Gods. He’d learned that the ratmen of Clan Gritus had commissioned a great beast - a true abomination from the flesh-shapers of Clan Moulder. In his fervour-vision, the Shaman also saw thousands upon thousands of screeching rats scratching on bloody walls, desperate to escape their fleshy prison...\n\nYou headed into the cold north where Clan Gritus had last been seen. Rats are notoriously hard to corner, however, and the trail was suddenly at risk of going cold. Razing a few settlements as sacrifices to the Dark Gods, it became evident that they are as keen as you to grab this prize and they illuminated the path ahead, leading you to the vicinity of the Temple of Addidoth. The abomination must be worth a great deal to the Ruinous Powers, or perhaps slaying such prey will inconvenience the Skaven's own bastard god, the Great Horned Rat? In any case, the way forward is now clear: the hunt is on!\n\nThe trail now goes below ground. This is home territory for the ratmen, but not so much for the Norse, who prefer enough room to swing their axes. Caution is advised.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_tyrion_sunfang_stage_4	The conspiracy is traced to Saphery, where the princes' lies have spread to the Loremasters. While Tyrion simply tries to hunt down and face his accusers, he finds an aggressive battle line in the lee of the White Tower, for the mages of Hoeth have ever been Teclis' people. The princes would have that Tyrion’s recent actions prove that he is not the honourable Defender of Ulthuan but a Druchii sympathiser - a weakness of his lineage! Battle is inevitable...	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_tyrion_sunfang_stage_3	Tyrion has proven himself more than a mere warrior, but a capable general and leader of the Asur! Back in court, the conniving princes hide their victorious smiles, Tyrion has played into their hands. The princes whisper to others that the so-called Defender of Ulthuan has grown out of control, that he should be ostracised from Finubar’s warrior council. They say this all while sipping the finest wine from silver chalices, and secretly agree to reconvene in Saphery.\n\nOf course, even as these nobles bask in their self-congratulatory hubris, they forget that while Tyrion is no politician he is certainly no puppet either. It will soon be time to teach these fools a lesson in manners and he will not need Sunfang to do so!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_tyrion_sunfang_stage_2	The Elven lust for intrigue can be insatiable… and often self-destructive. A certain cohort of princes, envious of Tyrion’s influence over King Finubar, seeks to exploit the situation of the failing Vortex and Teclis’ sudden departure to Lustria for his own gain. The jealous princes utter a poisonous rumour in court and let's their race's proclivity for scandal do the rest... \n\nTyrion’s pride burns as deeply as any Dwarf’s, and that can make him predictable. The veiled insult eats at Tyrion - the claim that he is only so renowned because of the sword he wields has him cast it aside to prove it is not so. Yet such rumours have a tendency to grow like a spider's web, catching larger flies. Soon the talk of the courts is that Tyrion is no campaigner. While those in battle may fear the Defender of Ulthuan - on grander strategies, such as depriving the foe of hideaways or destroying enemy supply routes, Tyrion is clueless - or so the rumours asserted. Tyrion could ignore such bunkum, but his pride prevents him. He shall prove the naysayers wrong!	true

For an Elf, he is a being of simple tastes, and a rare straight-talker who despises dressing up his words in needless confections and double-meanings - unlike the princes that frequent the court of the Phoenix Throne.\n\nIn Tyrion’s mind it is these dandy fools that will be their race’s undoing; while they prance about court furthering their own agendas, the Vortex struggles, and invasion is imminent. Tyrion quits the court in disgust and goes about mustering a force to repel the inevitable.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_main_vmp_heinrich_kemmler_skull_staff_stage_1.1	The abbey at La Maisontaal in northern Bretonnia has long held Heinrich Kemmler’s interest. It is a major centre of worship for the Nature-God, Taal, and is therefore worthy of destruction in Kemmler’s eyes. More significantly, it serves as a repository for several powerful artefacts. Unfortunately, the abbey is well defended by the forces of the local duke, meaning that any straightforward attack upon it would prove costly. Fortunately the Lichemaster has a plan of pleasingly wicked deviousness. First of all he requires raw materials.	true

He takes up the dark puppet strings of Necromancy and soon a band of Empire troops stands before him once more with only the odd spatter of gore and their dead eyes betraying their true nature. With a rasping chuckle, Kemmler sets off for Axe Bite Pass, the main route through the Grey Mountains for pilgrims travelling to the abbey. Once there, he intends to have his new ‘Empire recruits’ waylay pilgrims as they make their way through the pass. Once word of this supposed aggression reaches the Abbey, it would be strange if there is no response, and Kemmler will be ready to capitalise on the ensuing strife.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_vortex_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_1	Luthor Harkon has been looking for a way to restore his connection to the Winds of Magic for decades. Many years ago he disturbed an ancient chamber sealed with some powerful glyphs, which retaliated by draining away his powers. In addition to losing his spellcasting abilities, his mind was shattered into a dozen different facets which left him teetering on the brink of insanity.\n\nWell aware of his mental instabilities, Luthor realises he can no longer risk losing control at a crucial moment, for if a weaker personality were to take over during a fight it could mean the difference between victory and defeat. At the very worst, such a situation could be his very undoing. He decides he needs a capable first mate to take command of his Undead crewmen should he falter at an inconvenient time.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_great_vortex_hef_alith_anar_the_moonbow_stage_1	The Moonbow's quiver is empty. No ordinary arrows can be loosed by such a bow – only those fletched with feathers soaked in Druchii blood warrant the string to be drawn.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_vortex_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_2	With control over his Undead crew better asserted, Luthor decides to step up his efforts to repair his damaged psyche. He does not know for sure, but thinks it likely that the glyphs which drained his powers and shattered his mind all those years ago were of Slann origin. In a moment of manic realisation, Luthor concludes that the best chance he has to undo his impairments is to find powerful artefacts from the same source.\n\nThe Slann – a powerful species of Lizardmen with an unparalleled mastery over the Sorcerous arts – are known to use many enchanted totems and trinkets of gold to serve their indecipherable purposes. The best chance of finding one is to search the most ancient ruins of the long-abandoned cities and towns of Lustria and beyond, where the Slann are most likely to have left their mark. It may be a long shot, but one that Luthor is desperate enough to take.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_vortex_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_3	Having ordered his Undead crewmen to leave no stone unturned, it seems that the ruins do not contain the artefacts Luthor seeks. His Zombie Deckhands manage to capture a small, reptile-like creature hiding amongst the rubble, which they drag hissing and writhing before him. Gathering himself for a moment, Luthor recognises it as a Skink – a smaller species of Lizardman, typically more mentally agile than others in their cold-blooded ranks. Surely this peon knows how to get his hands on what Luthor seeks?\n\nHe demands that the location of any nearby enchanted Slann Gold be revealed, but is brazenly ignored. This lizard-minion obviously does not know who it is dealing with – patience and rationality are not qualities present in any of his fractured personalities. In an instant, Luthor is pressing his pistol against the Skink’s head, muttering lunacies and cocking the hammer. The startled prisoner immediately starts blurts out something about a chest of glyph-embossed medallions buried underneath the very ruins in which they stand. The Skink claims they had previously belonged to the great Mage-Priest Mazdamundi himself, but had been stolen by one of several expeditions that had recently passed through the region.\n\nLuthor turns away to ponder, leaving the Lizardman to his starved Scurvy Dogs. The chest of Slann Gold could be anywhere by now, and finding it will not be simple. Luthor flies into a sudden rage, growling to his crew to prepare for a long campaign of despoilment. He will sack cities near and far in his search, caring not for the wars he might start!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_vortex_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold_stage_4	After looting countless settlements and torturing thousands of unfortunate victims, Luthor and his pirate horde come across a shackled slave who claims to have been a former soldier of the Empire. He tells Luthor that he had recently been part of an expeditionary force that found a chest of embossed Slann Gold, but on their way back to camp they were ambushed by a vast Lizardmen army, the largest he had ever seen. The soldier narrowly escaped with his life, but everyone in his troop was slaughtered and the Lizardmen made off back to Lustria with their gold.\n\nClearly this hoard is of great importance to the Lizardmen for them to have brought such a force to take it back – there must be more to this gold than its monetary value alone. Luthor can see his goal clearly now, his mind yearning to be repaired. He needs to gather his minions, return to Lustria, and attack these cold-blooded freaks!	true

Although the Giant's movements are still unknown, the locals tell you of a Bretonnian herb collector who might know where the brute lives.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_great_vortex_cylostra_the_bordeleaux_flabellum_mp	A self-obsessed singer needs a doting audience, and Cylostra is technically still well overdue for a high-profile performance before the High Elves of Ulthuan. Many years ago, when the Lamprey succumbed to a storm in the Eastern Straits of the Great Ocean, before Cylostra’s transformation, she was on an important diplomatic voyage to sing before the Phoenix King. A treaty of great import was reliant on his pleasure in her performance, for the Elves believe good art – music in particular – to be as valuable as gems and gold. It was an important engagement, so surely the High Elves will still be waiting for her? Cylostra decided to head towards the southern end of the Shifting Isles, where the High Elves' Old World shipping lanes are located, following them directly into the great Elven port of Lothern and, hopefully, to the Phoenix King himself... \n\nCylostra orders the Lamprey through the Shifting Isles – the ones that are currently visible, at least – ordering her lookouts to keep their rotting eyeballs peeled. At first it seems there's no High Elf naval presence anywhere to be seen - whether the Asur are under the magical protection of the ancient spells shrouding the area, or are simply eluding her by other means, Cylostra does not know. Suddenly, she spots a ship moored off one of the islands, where large numbers of troops are disembarking. And what's this? Could it be the standard of the Phoenix King she sees? From the look of the ship, it certainly belongs to the High Elf fleet at the very least. There's not time to waste - only time to get ready for the show!	true

missions_localised_description_wh_main_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_axe_of_dargo_stage_3_mpc	Having consulted with his Guild, the Runesmith reports that the missing runes are amongst those whose mysteries have been lost to the Dwarfs for centuries. However, the Guild’s council suspects that in revealing its song to Ungrim, the axe is attempting to make itself whole once more, seeking the aid of Ungrim’s kindred warrior soul to do so. By wholly aligning his spirit with the axe in the crucible of battle, the Slayer King may be able to provide the counterpoint to mend the blade’s song. Such perfection of alignment is more likely to be achieved in a high place, closer to the Ancestor gods, and against an adversary of great skill in battle-craft. In his many hours of contemplation before the Slayer Shrine, Ungrim catches a gossamer thread of song coming from the north. Rising, he orders the horns sounded to summon his throng.	true

Sigvald finds his attention wandering to a complacent consideration of the perfection in his own immaculately manicured hand.

The ground reshapes itself to let the warrior pass, and his feet float an inch above the world’s surface so that his boots are never touched by the mud or gore of the battlefield.

He brazenly enters the Black Council’s chamber and approaches the obsidian table – where the Witch King sits with his most loyal advisors – proclaiming that he knows the Supreme Spellshield’s whereabouts and will share it for a price. In the chamber sit a hundred Lords, none of whom can remember such an audacious attempt to provoke the Witch King; many see Strenious’ life lasting only seconds more!\n\nYet Malekith does not unleash his legendary rage.

Malekith makes a great show of thanking the Captain, and pays him then and there. As Strenious smiles upon the wealth he’s suddenly accumulated, the Witch King grabs the captain by the throat and casually throws him over the side of the great vessel. His fortune follows him into the sea, for Malekith cares not for riches, it is power he has always craved.\n\nStrenious’ crew do not bat an eyelid at their master’s sudden death, but quickly make themselves busy when the Witch King orders his army disembarked for an expedition to retrieve the lost shield.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_brt_louen_armour_of_brilliance	The Bretonnian warrior Agilulf is well known amongst the dukedom's Knightly classes. Once a great Grail Knight, he successfully embarked on countless chivalrous quests to rid the world of its foulest monsters - thousands were slain by his sword. He was also famous for the glittering armour he wore, which possessed a magical sheen that would blind his enemies in combat, frequently giving him the upper hand. No-one really knows what became of Agilulf or how he met his end, needless to say that he failed to return from his final Knightly quest and was assumed to have been killed. Neither he nor his resplendent armour were ever seen again – until today!\n\nA piece of armour bearing Agilulf’s heraldry is brought before King Louen, recovered by a group of Grail Knights returning from a holy quest. The iconography proves beyond doubt that the armour belonged to a member of Agilulf’s household, but it does not possess the fabled radiance and is surprisingly brittle. Upon consulting with the Fay Enchantress, King Louen discovers both that it is indeed Agilulf’s armour and that its sheen and durability are magically linked, its dullness and fragility an indication that its magical properties have long since waned. The only way to restore Agilulf's armour is to buff and polish until its brilliance returns, firstly by melting it down and then by re-forging it. Such work is no job for a peasant smithy – instead, this requires a master craftsman's hands.	true

To keep them at bay, Isabella must therefore employ ever darker methods. Whilst she plots and prepares, however, she must know more about her foes.

Though she cannot be sure, the sense of great darkness and dread leads Isabella to believe that this horn is one of the fabled Ruinous Gifts, bestowed upon the Beastmen by the Chaos Gods themselves. Although fascinated by it, Isabella knows that consuming this God-blighted cruor would tear her apart. She must consult those who know of these things - the dark and twisted Necromancers - to reveal more.	true

According to her dark magicians only one stage remains: she must defile the resting place of a great and mighty soul. She knows of no greater soul than Marbad, First of the Elector Counts, and interred nearby. Soon, Isabella muses, she will sup on the blood of the Chaos Gods themselves! Gathering her forces beneath the cowering moon, she sets out for his tomb with unmatched thirst.	true

The ritual requires, as these things so often do, a massive, living sacrifice, something on a scale that even Isabella finds shocking. The souls and blood would must then be stored inside a precious von Carstein heirloom. Isabella, already excited by the scale of the slaughter to come, fetches an ancient, exquisite chalice that was given to her by her great-grandmother, Countess Bathori, and readies herself to fill it.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_5	While on the approach to Skjold, the Swordfysh encountered a small vessel of Marauders that Aranessa’s crew managed to overpower and capture. Before being forced to walk the plank into Promethean-infested waters, one of the captives reveals to Aranessa why the Skjold raiders targeted Manann’s children so relentlessly, alleging that when the chieftain of Skjold heard of the Queen of Tides, he flew into a fit of rage, claiming that she must be his daughter who he’d thought dead and lost. The truth is that he threw Aranessa into the ocean as a baby, believing she would attract the ire of the Dark Gods he was so desperate to impress. She was born bearing the mutations of the sea, which are considered to be a curse sent to draw the ire of the Ruinous Powers. For many Norscans, to accept the gifts of one God is to shun those of another, and so some mutations are punishable by death lest the Dark Gods become jealous. \n\nThe Skjold chieftain mobilised his fleet as soon as he learned that Aranessa was still alive, believing that by murdering as many sea creatures as possible he could prove beyond doubt his rejection of Aranessa before his Gods. She is no longer a baby to be thrown away, however – she is the Queen of Tides, favoured by Manann, who will ensure the Sea-God has his revenge. Saltspite can wait no longer for the Empire’s help - she pledges to slay the pathetic wretch claiming to be her birth-father by her own hand!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_4	After burning several Norscan villages to the ground, Aranessa finds the information she seeks. The raiding parties originated from the Norscan coastal town of Skjold, whose marauders have been targeting islands in the neighbouring seas, slaughtering all marine creatures they encountered and offering them as sacrifices to their Dark Gods. A rage stirs within Aranessa and her heart weeps; such murderous acts against Manann's children cannot be tolerated! Long ago, the Sea-God took her in, raising her as his own daughter through a trio of Sea Nymphs living on one of those very isles.\n\nThe source of the raids must be found, so Aranessa may avenge the slain. With Skjold her next destination, she sends a messenger informing Captain Ludenhof what she has discovered before setting sail.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_3	As the final Norscan battle cries are snuffed out, the crew of the Swordfysh call out to their captain to announce that a ship with Empire markings is approaching. Aranessa, known for never letting her guard down, has fired on the Empire before, when they’d approached her unannounced, so they must have important business to risk such a manoeuvre. She allows the ship to approach peacefully, and the commanding officer of the vessel announces himself as an Empire captain by the name of Kolt Ludenhof. He is offering Saltspite a deal – the Empire wish to quell the recent Norscan menace by any means necessary to secure their ocean trading routes. Should Aranessa aid him in this task, she is assured of a generous reward. Aranessa contemplates the offer – she will suffer an alliance with the Empire just as long as there's worthwhile profit to be made.\n\nWith the deal agreed, Ludenhof requests Saltspite head to Norsca to gather more information on what the Norscans are up to. As a down-payment for this task, Aranessa is presented with an incredible gem the size of a fist. Her permanent scowl breaks for a moment and a smile shines across her face with the glow of a new dawn, for her love of jewels is well known. Her scowl quickly returns, however, for now a hunt is about to begin. To Norsca!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_2	Sartosa is a haven for pirates, smugglers, and seafaring lowlifes. Sure enough, one of its denizens spotted something while out on a recent journey on the open seas - a band of Norscan raiders was sighted slaughtering sea creatures. The rumours are that they have declared war upon Manann himself in the name of their Chaos Gods. In response, Aranessa immediately calls on her crew to set sail for Norsca, barking out her orders with bitter, hate-filled words, for only Norscans can draw such ire from their captain. The living members of her crew make the sign of Manann, quietly reciting prayers in anticipation of the fight to come, for Saltspite has already decided the fate of the Northmen responsible for these crimes against the sea, and along with her deckhands she will ensure that they pay for their villainy!	true

The Sea-God must be in great distress, for the power he gifts Aranessa through Krakens' Bane to be wavering so. The Queen of Tides has sensed the sea is unsettled, that a storm is brewing of such scale that Aranessa herself may struggle to traverse it unscathed. Manann is clearly in pain, and only she can aid the deity and restore power to Krakens' Bane, so she must find the source of this pain and heal it before the seas become a maelstrom. Her first stop is Sartosa, where someone is bound to have some information about the sea’s growing unrest...	true

Mannfred knows of such a locus, an Arcane Fulcrum of bone deep in the Badlands. It is where Greenskins gather to conduct their pathetic shamanic rites.

Over the centuries though, the ties have loosened inexorably. Beset by ever greater threats and an inexorable series of defeats, the Dwarfs retreated into their remaining mountain Holds, and the power of the Empire dwindled under the yoke of weak, foolish or wicked Emperors, until it was finally brought to its knees.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_great_vortex_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_2	Sartosa is a haven for pirates, smugglers, and seafaring lowlifes. Sure enough, one of its denizens spotted something while out on a recent journey on the open seas - a band of Norscan raiders was sighted slaughtering sea creatures. The rumours are that they have declared war upon Manann himself in the name of their Chaos Gods. In response, Aranessa immediately calls on her crew to set sail for Norsca, barking out her orders with bitter, hate-filled words, for only Norscans can draw such ire from their captain. The living members of her crew make the sign of Manann, quietly reciting prayers in anticipation of the fight to come, for Saltspite has already decided the fate of the Northmen responsible for these crimes against the sea, and along with her deckhands she will ensure that they pay for their villainy!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_great_vortex_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_3	As the final Norscan battle cries are snuffed out, the crew of the Swordfysh call out to their captain to announce that a ship with Empire markings is approaching. Aranessa, known for never letting her guard down, has fired on the Empire before, when they’d approached her unannounced, so they must have important business to risk such a manoeuvre. She allows the ship to approach peacefully, and the commanding officer of the vessel announces himself as an Empire captain by the name of Kolt Ludenhof. He is offering Saltspite a deal – the Empire wish to quell the recent Norscan menace by any means necessary to secure their ocean trading routes. Should Aranessa aid him in this task, she is assured of a generous reward. Aranessa contemplates the offer – she will suffer an alliance with the Empire just as long as there's worthwhile profit to be made.\n\nWith the deal agreed, Ludenhof requests Saltspite head to Norsca to gather more information on what the Norscans are up to. As a down-payment for this task, Aranessa is presented with an incredible gem the size of a fist. Her permanent scowl breaks for a moment and a smile shines across her face with the glow of a new dawn, for her love of jewels is well known. Her scowl quickly returns, however, for now a hunt is about to begin. To Norsca!	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_great_vortex_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_1	The strength of Krakens' Bane wanes and the Seafather's blessings are weakening! The Sea-God must be in great distress, for the power he gifts Aranessa through Krakens' Bane to be wavering so. The Queen of Tides has sensed the sea is unsettled, that a storm is brewing of such scale that Aranessa herself may struggle to traverse it unscathed. Manann is clearly in pain, and only she can aid the deity and restore power to Krakens' Bane, so she must find the source of this pain and heal it before the seas become a maelstrom. Her first stop is Sartosa, where someone is bound to have some information about the sea’s growing unrest...	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_great_vortex_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_4	After burning several Norscan villages to the ground, Aranessa finds the information she seeks. The raiding parties originated from the Norscan coastal town of Skjold, whose marauders have been targeting islands in the neighbouring seas, slaughtering all marine creatures they encountered and offering them as sacrifices to their Dark Gods. A rage stirs within Aranessa and her heart weeps; such murderous acts against Manann's children cannot be tolerated! Long ago, the Sea-God took her in, raising her as his own daughter through a trio of Sea Nymphs living on one of those very isles.\n\nThe source of the raids must be found, so Aranessa may avenge the slain. With Skjold her next destination, she sends a messenger informing Captain Ludenhof what she has discovered before setting sail.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_great_vortex_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane_stage_5	While on the approach to Skjold, the Swordfysh encountered a small vessel of Marauders that Aranessa’s crew managed to overpower and capture. Before being forced to walk the plank into Promethean-infested waters, one of the captives reveals to Aranessa why the Skjold raiders targeted Manann’s children so relentlessly, alleging that when the chieftain of Skjold heard of the Queen of Tides, he flew into a fit of rage, claiming that she must be his daughter who he’d thought dead and lost. The truth is that he threw Aranessa into the ocean as a baby, believing she would attract the ire of the Dark Gods he was so desperate to impress. She was born bearing the mutations of the sea, which are considered to be a curse sent to draw the ire of the Ruinous Powers. For many Norscans, to accept the gifts of one God is to shun those of another, and so some mutations are punishable by death lest the Dark Gods become jealous. \n\nThe Skjold chieftain mobilised his fleet as soon as he learned that Aranessa was still alive, believing that by murdering as many sea creatures as possible he could prove beyond doubt his rejection of Aranessa before his Gods. She is no longer a baby to be thrown away, however – she is the Queen of Tides, favoured by Manann, who will ensure the Sea-God has his revenge. Saltspite can wait no longer for the Empire’s help - she pledges to slay the pathetic wretch claiming to be her birth-father by her own hand!	true

The King's agent sends word that he was found on the outskirts of the Arden Forest, battered and bloodied and, ultimately, beyond saving. Yet hope remains; a notebook was found on his desecrated cadaver, which the agent delivered to the King with great urgency.\n\nUpon its battered and weathered pages, it is revealed that the wanderer was an elder Questing Knight, lost to the records of the Bretonnians, whose final pledge was to 'clear the mist of all evil'. Accompanying his final quest is a an intricately-detailed map of the Forest of Arden; at the centre, deep within the woods, he has marked a clearing, labelled only as the 'source of evil', which must be the camp of the Orc Warboss presiding over the destruction.\n\nLeoncoeur has no other leads, and if this Knight is to be believed, the mist's source, and ultimate defeat, lies at the heart of the Forest of Arden.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_great_vortex_qb_cst_aranessa_saltspite_krakens_bane_MP	The strength of Krakens' Bane was waning, the Seafather's blessings weakening! The rumours were that a band of Norscan raiders had declared war upon Manann himself in the name of their Chaos Gods, slaughtering innocent creatures of the sea, so Aranessa immediately called upon her crew to set sail for Norsca, swearing that they would pay for their villainy! \n\nAfter burning several Norscan villages to the ground, Aranessa found the information she sought, with the help of an Empire captain named Kolt Ludenhof. The raiding parties had originated from the Norscan coastal town of Skjold, whose marauders were targeting islands in the neighbouring seas, slaughtering all marine creatures they encountered and offering them as sacrifices to their Dark Gods. They were under orders from their chieftain, who claimed that the Queen of Tides must be his daughter, who he’d thought dead and lost. The truth is that he threw Aranessa into the ocean as a baby, believing she would attract the ire of the Dark Gods due to the mutations of the sea she bore, which among the Norscans are considered to be a curse. The Skjold chieftain mobilised his fleet as soon as he learned that Aranessa was still alive, believing that by murdering as many sea creatures as possible, he could prove beyond doubt his rejection of Aranessa before the Gods.\n\nCaptain Saltspite is no longer a baby to be thrown away, however – she is the Queen of Tides, favoured by Manann, who will ensure the Sea-God has his revenge!	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_7	The scale of the battle fought between the Stirlander Lord and the Abyssal Shrieker must have been immense. At the location of the hunter’s defeat you find swathes of land that once contained villages and vegetation that had been flattened in a massive skirmish, with the ancient remains of people and animals caught up in encounter strewn across the land. Following a trail of bones, you find the Terrorgheist’s lair in a nearby haunted forest – an obvious location for the dwelling of such an evil creature. You will surely succeed where the ‘great’ Stirlander Hunter failed!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_6	Your scouts inform you that the crazy Dwarfs are in fact hunting the herd to settle an old grudge – revenge for the Mawherd's trampling of one of their past throng leaders. Stranger still, while you have been on the trail of this mighty mammoth herd, you have not seen any actual traces of its presence anywhere. Large herds of such gargantuan beasts are known to indiscriminately trample anything that gets in their way while on their migration routes – vegetation, settlements, people – but you’ve observed limited evidence of such activity. With the Dwarf expedition now heading towards High Pass, it is time to go and witness The Great Mawherd of Bloodfjord for yourself, if indeed it is actually there!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_5	At long last, the dragon has taken your bait! While burning the region around the Oak of Ages to ashes, your scouts report seeing a great Forest Dragon lurking in front of the great tree.

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_4	The Bretonnian herb collector you took so much trouble to find is almost mute with shock due to his experiences, but after some gentle coercing with torture, he reveals to you the location of the Giant’s dwelling. The lair of Blorgar the Mad Titan is located deep in Grey Mountains, in one of the few mushroom caves large enough for him to live in. It is time to march back there and enter the bowels of the earth to hunt the Giant down!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_3	It did not take long for the location of the tunnel entrance to be discovered. There are multiple giant spider tracks leading into the subterranean passageway, making it easy to identify as the one you seek. Being cautious, you send scouts ahead to descend into the tunnel first, who return to tell you that the tunnel leads into an even bigger network of tunnels beneath. The spider tracks are as clear as day and the herd will be found, if only you follow them. All that remains is for you to lead your army down there…	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_2	Following your lead, your army strides into the wastelands of the far north. The slave was speaking the truth – your scouts report back that the monstrous Traygard has been spotted not far from your location, and if you move immediately you can cut him off at the Cliff of Beasts. At last! Your search may soon be at an end, and the great hunt will finally begin in earnest.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_1	You reach the edge of the forest, having taken on dozens of captives on the way. These unfortunates will serve as living bait to lure the Soul-Eaters out, who will likely be accompanied by the vicious Beastman herd they march with. The hostages are chained up and hammered to stakes upside down by their ankles, deliberately drawing their blood. The beasts will surely catch the scent, and it will be hard for them to resist the lure of injured, defenceless prey.\n\nFrom a safe distance you watch the doomed hostages, as their screams echo between the trees. Out of nowhere, a frighteningly large tide of Beastmen suddenly emerges from the thickets, gorily devouring the victims, ripping them piece from piece, limb from torso. Then, almost as quickly as they’d appeared, they were gone. The scene of carnage and bloodshed is immediately surveyed and two pairs of hoof marks are found amongst the gored bodies, much larger than that of even the largest Cygors ever seen. Your bounty is here!\n\nYou give the order to march directly into the dark, uninviting wood, following the enormous tracks. The Forest of Shadows shall give up its prize – the Salzenmund Soul-Eaters will be yours to sacrifice!	true

They are encamped on a defensible ridge, and have brought their bizarre artillery to further fortify the position – they appear ready to fight to the last. Further reports seem to indicate that they are bolstered by a great gathering of Warbosses, who seem bent on bringing their full strength to bear against you.

missions_localised_description_wh_main_grn_grimgor_ironhide_gitsnik_stage_4	The axe-carrying Warboss met a powerful Empire force at Black Fire Pass and was defeated. Presumably, the magic choppa remains with his corpse. All indications are that the humies remain in the pass, preparing to march back up north, but they might be persuaded to stay long enough for Grimgor to have a crack at them. The Black Orc Warboss orders his mob to march on the pass, and to announce their approach by burning everything en route. The humie scum will have no choice but to stay and face a far deadlier threat than that 'pretenda' that now lies rotting in the pass with Grimgor's choppa!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_main_grn_grimgor_ironhide_gitsnik_stage_3	Having infiltrated another tribe, the Goblin listened to rumours being discussed around the campfire and eventually came up with the name of a Greenskin who might have more information. Waylaying his victim, he extracted further information before despatching him. It seems that the Warboss was probably headed for Black Fire Pass, on the borders of the Empire. The Goblin now heads to the area to continue his investigation.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_great_vortex_cst_cylostra_shifting_isles_high_elf	Cylostra orders the Lamprey through the Shifting Isles – the ones that are currently visible, at least – ordering her lookouts to keep their rotting eyeballs peeled. At first it seems there's no High Elf naval presence anywhere to be seen - whether the Asur are under the magical protection of the ancient spells shrouding the area, or are simply eluding her by other means, Cylostra does not know.\n\nSuddenly, she spots a ship moored off one of the islands, where large numbers of troops are disembarking. And what's this? Could it be the standard of the Phoenix King she sees? From the look of the ship, it certainly belongs to the High Elf fleet at the very least. There's not time to waste - only time to get ready for the show!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_main_grn_grimgor_ironhide_gitsnik_stage_2	The cringing Goblin reveals that he was on the trail of another Orc Warboss, said to have found a powerful axe somewhere in the mountains and headed north in search of some humies to try it out on. Eager for the chance of loot, the Goblin was hurrying to join his mob, but adds that no-one has heard from the Warboss since, though there are plenty of rumours of him amongst the various Greenskin tribes. Grimgor delays his plan to squish the Goblin spy and instead sends him to find out who knows anything of value, and to torture the information out of them.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_main_grn_grimgor_ironhide_gitsnik_stage_1	Several Goblins have been spotted sneaking around the Badlands. It stands to reason that they're up to no good, and there may be some fighting to be had at the end of it. Grimgor orders his scouts to bring one of them to him.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_skv_skrolk_rod_of_corruption_stage_2	The cold-bloods have become the focus of Skrolk’s impotent rage. Back in Skavenblight, Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch tuts at Skrolk’s performance, but still the Lizardmen must pay the price. But Lord Skrolk is more cunning than most. To outsiders he may seem to be lashing out, but those who know Skrolk know there is method in his fury. The Lizardmen hide knowledge; they have many secrets and one is the power to eat metal. Once he is rid of the reptiles, he will scour their plaques with eyes that cannot see until he finds out how to restore the Rod of Corruption.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_skv_skrolk_rod_of_corruption_stage_3	Lord Skrolk has discovered what the Lizardmen hide and the thing that he seeks - the power to befoul metal and restore the Rod of Corruption. To the north of Lustria lies the Island of the Crimson Skull; it is the Skull itself that Skrolk seeks, as it is made from a unique mineral that can be powdered into a red oxidising material that eats iron and steel. Once spread upon the Rod of Corruption, Skrolk’s weapon will be powerful once again. Then he can return to his grand schemes.\n\nFirst, he must deal with the Council while the Great Vortex remains unstable, but that is what this lick-spittle scribe is for. Let the Council be distracted by this scheme, so Skrolk can plan his ascension to Arch-Plaguelord without interference.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_skv_skrolk_rod_of_corruption_stage_1	Skrolk’s deadly rod has been at his side for the many decades the Plaguelord has walked the world. It is said that the rod was awarded to Skrolk in the wake of his blindness. When he clawed at his own eyes after bearing witness to Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch, Skrolk wished no other vision to obscure that glimpse of pestilent perfection.\n\nDespite this, Nurglitch does not brook failure, and remains unimpressed with Skrolk’s performance since the Vortex became vulnerable. Matters are not helped by the Rod of Corruption’s recent inability to cast rust upon metal. Flesh will still slough from bones when struck, but where before metal would oxidise and corrode, it remains gleaming. Skrolk suspects that the recent Vortex activity and his rod’s lack of corruption are linked, but first he must appease the Arch-Plaguelord and bolster Clan Pestilens' forces.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_teclis_war_crown_of_saphery_stage_1	The War Crown is seldom seen outside the walls of the White Tower. Even Teclis himself wears it only in times of great need, so he sets off to Lustria without it. However, it quickly becomes apparent that circumstances are direr than even the High Loremaster realised, and so he sends for the crown. A pair of Great Eagles are dispatched from Saphery with the crown securely held their claws. An epic journey follows, crossing the Great Ocean and then the continent itself.\n\n Perhaps it was inevitable, on a flight that long, that the Eagles would not reach Teclis. Something has gone wrong - the crown and its winged escort are lost. An artefact of such power and reverence cannot be allowed to simply vanish. Teclis knows of a ritual of Isha that should be invoked, for a mother always knows where her children lie, and the War Crown is of Isha's making.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_teclis_war_crown_of_saphery_stage_2	The ritual grants Teclis knowledge, but not the whole answer. He knows that the Eagles were brought down deliberately, somewhere over the Spine of Sotek.

missions_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_teclis_war_crown_of_saphery_stage_3	The location is revealed. Isha’s light guides Teclis and his Sapherian host to a dark, dank cavern in the north of mountain chain. On entering the cave, the High Elves are assaulted by a unholy stench. Some turn their noses up and even consider returning to the surface, but Teclis gives them a stern look and bids they advance further into the depths.\n\nA piercing scream echoes through the cavern; the master of the lair is in residence! Bones drop from the ceiling to come crashing amidst the High Elven host. The carcasses of two Eagles litter the cavern floor. Teclis looks up to see the hunter that ripped them from the sky - a gigantic Undead bat…\n\nBut even this beast does not seem to be alone, for in the shadows, scuttling all around the periphery of the cave, the Elves hear mocking chitters!	true

missions_localised_description_wh_pro01_dwf_grombrindal_amour_of_glimril_scales_stage_1	There is no hearth the White Dwarf calls home. He wanders the Karaz Ankor, mostly in disguise, with hooded cloak hiding his face, if not his magnificent beard. When Dwarfkind is in trouble, when an ancient grudge needs settling, then Grombrindal will be there to lend his legendary axe and mighty skills in battle - a great boon for any throng!\n\nIn most cases, it is the White Dwarf that seeks out such peril. He will arrive unheralded before, or even during, battle - when all looks lost. However, there have been occasions when Grombrindal has been 'summoned'. If the tales hold true, opening a cask and pouring a flagon of the local master brewer's most precious ale - all while cursing the Black Goblin in flawless ancient Khazalid - mean the White Dwarf will appear soon after.\n\nThat is how a group of renowned Rangers claimed to get Grombrindal's attention. After the White Dwarf had quaffed his flagon of Bugman's Troll Chaser (so called, as all you want to do is find and kill a Troll after one swig), the Rangers relayed their message - that none other than the greatest Brewmaster himself, Josef Bugman, was in need of the White Dwarf's aid. Grombrindal, helped himself to another flagon and downed it in one. After wiping his whiskers with his sleeve, he bade the Rangers accompany him to the Grey Mountains and from there to Bugman's Brewery. As the Rangers broke camp, none dared to enquire as to why Grombrindal's armour was missing many of its fine scales, and the White Dwarf himself certainly didn't care to mention it.           	true

It undoubtedly belongs to the Cult of Pleasure; the worshippers of Slaanesh. The message speaks of their prowling of Athel Loren's glades, but nobody can know exactly where. Orion's rage is great. He is moments away from ordering the destruction of the glade, in order to find the interlopers, when the Sisters present an alternate plan. The letter hails from Bretonnia, tracing its source would enable its destination to be ascertained and much destruction avoided.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_qb_cst_aranessa_saltspite_krakens_bane_MP	The strength of Krakens' Bane was waning, the Seafather's blessings weakening! The rumours were that a band of Norscan raiders had declared war upon Manann himself in the name of their Chaos Gods, slaughtering innocent creatures of the sea, so Aranessa immediately called upon her crew to set sail for Norsca, swearing that they would pay for their villainy! \n\nAfter burning several Norscan villages to the ground, Aranessa found the information she sought, with the help of an Empire captain named Kolt Ludenhof. The raiding parties had originated from the Norscan coastal town of Skjold, whose marauders were targeting islands in the neighbouring seas, slaughtering all marine creatures they encountered and offering them as sacrifices to their Dark Gods. They were under orders from their chieftain, who claimed that the Queen of Tides must be his daughter, who he’d thought dead and lost. The truth is that he threw Aranessa into the ocean as a baby, believing she would attract the ire of the Dark Gods due to the mutations of the sea she bore, which among the Norscans are considered to be a curse. The Skjold chieftain mobilised his fleet as soon as he learned that Aranessa was still alive, believing that by murdering as many sea creatures as possible, he could prove beyond doubt his rejection of Aranessa before the Gods.\n\nCaptain Saltspite is no longer a baby to be thrown away, however – she is the Queen of Tides, favoured by Manann, who will ensure the Sea-God has his revenge!	true

New Holds were founded, from the Grey Mountains in the west to the Mountains of Mourn in the east, from the Dragonback Mountains in the south to the ice-locked peaks of Norsca in the north. Then came the Time of Woes, when a series of disasters led to the fall of countless Holds and the sons of Grungni found themselves penned into their remaining Karaks. With the reclamation of the World's Edge Mountains under way, Thorgrim’s thoughts turn northwards to the once-mighty Hold of Kraka Drak in Norsca.

Then came the Time of Woes, when a series of disasters led to the fall of countless Holds and the sons of Grungni found themselves penned into their remaining Karaks. With the reclamation of the World's Edge Mountains underway, Thorgrim’s thoughts turn northwards to the once-mighty Hold of Kraka Drak in Norsca. If the Norscan Dwarfs have endured the Time of Woes and Kraka Drak remains unconquered, it would be invaluable in the struggle against the Norscan tribes who feed the forces of Chaos. The High King dispatches agents northwards to discover the fate of the Norse Dwarfs.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_main_dwf_thorgrim_grudgebearer_armour_of_skaldour_stage_3.2	Alas, Kraka Drak is no more, and another grudge must be marked in the Great Book, perhaps along with an oath to re-establish the Hold at some point. For now though, Thorgrim pores over the reports on the movements of the Norse tribes, and other significant events. It would seem that the Troll Country, a malign wilderness in south-eastern Norsca, has seen a steady rise in the numbers of hideous creatures stalking its ice-wracked forests and tundra. Countless numbers of Trolls and Giants, pressured by the increased competition for food and territory, have been displaced into the World's Edge Mountains and other civilised lands. It is time for a cull. And whenever there is a foul monster in need of vanquishing, there you will find the Slayers: death-sworn followers of the Slayer Cult, in search of the most dangerous adversaries upon which to unleash their mighty axe-craft.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_main_qb_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_slayer_crown_stage_4_leitziger_ford	Having pursued the enemy for several days, Ungrim's throng finally tracks them down to an ill-omened shrine near the River Stir on the borders of Talabecland and Stirland. There is no sign of a dragon cave and it would seem that this force was merely a distraction. Nevertheless, they are a threat that needs dealing with. The Undead horde are arrayed for battle around the shrine, before which some sort of summoning ritual is being conducted by a black-robed figure. Desperate to interrupt the evil rite, the Dwarfs charge.	true

Delving within the ancient flayed skin covers of the fell tome, the Count finds much of interest. Amongst the pages is an examination of binding; funnelling Dark Magic into ancient physical artefacts. When a great quantity of spirit essence is released, it can be harnessed and bound into an item through the use of magical power. Mannfred knows of such a locus, an Arcane Fulcrum of bone deep in the Badlands. It is where Greenskins gather to conduct their pathetic shamanic rites. He dispatches one of his minions to survey the area.	true

Count Mannfred is, of course, welcome to the book - for a price.

Yet this impudent ambition can on occasion prove of use to a true Lord of Death such as Count Mannfred.

The fact he has achieved such an iron grip, although merely a Night Goblin and not some brutal Orc, says more about his malign intelligence than any chapter in some stunties' silly book!\n\nThe Angrund Clan is no more. However, that doesn’t mean Skarsnik can sit safely on his throne of rat skulls. Many covet the lost valuables buried deep in the ancient Dwarf citadel. However, nothing escapes the eyes and ears of the Warlord. News of an enemy treasure-seeking expedition quickly reaches him and a wicked plan begins to form within the chief gobbo’s mind.

Kroq-Gar’s service to Lizard-kind is beyond counting, yet the Saurus must still prove himself worthy of the mantle and ensure his own thoughts align with Mazdamundi’s xenophobic interpretation of the Great Plan.\n\nA few leagues from the Hexoatl, the City of the Sun, Elven servants of Ulthuan interfere with the Fallen Gates - an ancient portal of the Old Ones. Their intention may be honourable, but they cannot be allowed to tamper with mechanisms far beyond their limited understanding. The Asur must be stopped before their meddling summons something far more dangerous.\n\nKroq-Gar stands ready, but Mazdamundi counsels that a larger cohort is needed to face the Elves.	true

Such a long life has seen him, on occasion, fall into conflict with rival Slann whose interpretation of the Great Plan differs from his own. Nevertheless, when a summons comes from Lord Mazdamundi, the oldest and most powerful of all living Mage-Priests, Kroq-Gar is duty-bound to answer.\n\nThe command from Mazdamundi is weak, no doubt a result of the Great Warding’s disintegration, which in turn is due to the fading Vortex on the High Elf Isle of Ulthuan. The ancient Saurus decides that a Skink must tap into the Geomantic Web directly, to clarify Mazdamundi’s directive.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_main_emp_balthasar_gelt_staff_of_volans_stage_1	The Colleges of Magic in Altdorf are abuzz with intrigue. Every eight years, a wizard who has proven himself worthy may challenge the Master of the Colleges to a magical duel, with the winner becoming the next Supreme Patriarch. The competition even to become a candidate is white hot. Wizards, being what they are, mean the selection process is at best pedantic; at its worst, real enmities can develop. Balthasar Gelt is the Patriarch of the Gold Order, and tipped to win, but a rival Light Wizard, Gottfried Orr, desperate for the position, wants rid of Gelt before they even reach the Hall of Duels. While this is an open secret, no direct accusation can be made as that is not how wizards manage their affairs. However, Gelt is something of a maverick and knows he needs the edge when Orr inevitably makes his move. As such, the Gold Wizard sets about locating a valuable lodestone and harnessing its power. Lodestones sometimes occur in areas struck by lightning - areas such as Kislev, which has recently experienced heavy storm activity.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_main_emp_balthasar_gelt_staff_of_volans_stage_4	With his rival dispatched, Gelt returns to Altdorf to face the current Supreme Patriarch, Thyrus Gormann, in the Hall of Duels.

However, in their haste it would appear that the scouts were somewhat careless, as they have been followed to Kroak’s location by a force of those insidious ratmen, the Skaven! They plan to destroy him, once and for all, by incinerating his physical remains that anchor him to the world. This must not come to pass – defend Kroak from harm whilst his priests awaken him!	true

If you are wrong about the locations to the northwest, and we should find no dragon's corpse to serve me into death, I shall feast upon your soul". It seems that the Undead Lord is searching for new materials for use in his foul Necromancy.

However, the Maiden Guard have found a vile Northman of the Norse raiders, who claims knowledge and the lore needed to break the curse.\n\nHe will sing his sorry tale before the Everqueen as all do, for none can say falsehood in her presence. Yet, her advisors suggest caution. This dark-hearted mortal broke almost too easily... it may well be a trap. The Handmaidens ask they be sent in her stead; when they know it is safe they will summon their mistress.	true

His sorrow and rage are tempered only by his understanding that something is terribly wrong within the Deepwood. There can be no delaying; he summons his loyal Treekin to him, intent on discovering the truth behind the forest's ailment.	true

With the sacrificial victims shackled, anointed and otherwise prepared for their ignominious ends, Tehenhauin is ready for yet another great sacrifice to the Sotek the Serpent-God.

missions_localised_description_wh_main_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_dragon_cloak_of_fyrskar_stage_3.1	The war drums are pounding in the Badlands. The settlements belonging to the Greenskins seethe like anthills as the enraged Orcs gather to strike back at their tormentors. According to the High King’s plan, the trick is to ensure that the counterattack is channelled in a direction of the Dwarf’s choosing so that the final confrontation is on ground that favours them. Broken Leg Gully is a low pass in the World's Edge Mountains perfect for such a battle. All that is required is some bait to draw the raging Greenskin horde there. Summoning a trusted champion, Ungrim instructs him to infiltrate a Greenskin settlement and plant a scroll indicating the presence of a secret tunnel entrance in Broken Leg Gully and leading to the nearby Hold of Karak Kadrin. Such a tunnel doesn’t exist, but in their current state of rage, the Orcs will surely take the bait! 	true

This is an ancient portal - a cosmic bridge across which the Old Ones travelled quickly to the City of the Sun and the rest of Lustria.\n\nUpon arrival at the Fallen Gates, preparations are set; the ancient stellar engines start to fire up, the pylons begin to thrum… And then, Chaos comes.

The weakening of the Mask of Heavens began when the Master of Skies arrived in the Southlands jungles, leading Tiktaq’to to conclude that this continent must be the source of the disturbance. Be that as it may, the Southlands jungles are vast and immense, and searching through the dense jungle canopy is no easy feat, even for the most experienced aerial combatant among the Lizardmen.

As he picked through the remnants, the Thane was disturbed by a moaning sound and was horrified when shambling figures emerged from the fog. The dead walk Sylvania’s benighted land once more! Cutting a path out, the warrior made his escape. In the sickly moonlight he passed bands of the Undead, all of them lurching northwards toward the vile fog-enshrouded marshes of Hel Fenn. Sprinkling sand on the fresh ink with which he has recorded all of this, Thorgrim slams shut the Book of Grudges, ordering the horns to be sounded and the throng armed. Evil stalks Sylvania once more and the axes of the Dwarfs will oppose it, and as of old, they will face it at Hel Fenn.	true

Although she would not admit it - and should anyone suggest it, they would be first on the skin-flensing table - this has been about getting the attention of Malekith, proving to the Witch King what a powerful and indispensable force she is. But alas her achievements are of little consequence, and her son’s gaze remains fixed on the failing Vortex…\n\nAt least, that is what she wants her enemies to believe, for Morathi is intelligent and cunning. Let Hellebron and Felicion believe that she unleashes a trail of destruction as nothing more than a temper tantrum; the Hag Sorceress has a far worthier target in her sights. But first she will need captives and plenty of them, for preparations must be made before she can bring her dark arts to bear.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_def_morathi_heartrender_and_the_darksword_stage_5	The rites have been spoken and the seals of Hoeth broken; it is time for Morathi to conduct a ritual of her current patron, Hekarti. And with it shall come the power she needs to seek out her true target - a sanctuary of her hated kin. And when that is taken, her son and her enemies will surely notice her!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_def_morathi_heartrender_and_the_darksword_stage_2	The raiding has proved a useful respite for the Hag Sorceress, there are many slaves to torture and souls to claim. And yet the six-armed goddess, Hekarti, is as thirsty as Khaine. Morathi must recruit more of her kin if she is to continue this journey out from the under the shadow of her son’s dominion.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_def_morathi_heartrender_and_the_darksword_stage_3	With a force worthy of Ghrond, Morathi rides forth in search of even more victims. She cares not whether these are the insufferable reptiles that lurk in the south, more puppets of her son, or even the filthy vermin that have been spotted more and more of late. Of course, the greatest prizes are the Asur - their souls always taste the sweetest!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_def_morathi_heartrender_and_the_darksword_stage_1	Morathi, mother of the Witch King, Hag Sorceress of Ghrond. More than any other, she is responsible for the Druchii; for splitting the greatest of all races in twain. It is a claim few have made directly to her face, but one she would not deny - and would actually revel in - before flaying the skin off the accuser, of course.\n\nThe instruments of such torture would be her paired weapons; the spear, Heartrender and sister blade, the Darksword. These were gifts from her son. But relations between mother and child have soured of late, with the Witch King banishing her from his sight. And so, in a fit of pique, she puts her paired weapons aside to focus on inflicting misery upon any who cross her path.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_main_qb_vmp_heinrich_kemmler_skull_staff_stage_3_la_maisontaal_abbey	A sickly moon hangs low over the foothills of the Grey Mountains, casting a corpse-pale light on the plains beyond. The Lichemaster stands atop a ridge, watching as an Empire army emerges from Axe Bite Pass and marches toward the Abbey. Across the plain, the tiny figure of a Bretonnian rider can be dimly discerned as he rides frantically along the road from the Abbey to the fortress of Montfort. Kemmler’s plan has worked even better than he could have hoped! The fools of both blind nations are each other's throats thanks to his machinations! As the two forces clash, Kemmler signals for his Undead horde to move in for the kill. The abbey will fall, and the Lichemaster’s eyes glitter at the prospect of the power he will unearth within its walls.	true

Although as brutal and savage as all others, he also has a grim and malevolent cunning which has made him widely feared across the Old World. Proclaiming himself the King of Trolls, great heroes regularly ride northwards to attempt to slay him. And every season, Throgg dines on their flesh.\n\nRecently he became infuriated that he was missing his prized Wintertooth Crown, so headed southward into civilised lands, tearing through the villages and towns in search of it. He was unable to find any leads until he heard of a vast Dwarf convoy travelling from Karak Kadrin that had been seen moving towards Peak Pass. Within its ranks was one particular Runelord known to be an infamous hoarder of treasures. The Troll King decided that this convoy was as good a place as any to continue the search for his crown.\n\nThrogg now calls upon his force to march on Peak Pass. By raiding Dwarf lands, there is a good chance of finding out the convoy’s location.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_dwf_belegar_ironhammer_shield_of_defiance_stage_1	The Dwarfs of the Angrund Clan have a special hatred of urki and grobi, even more so than other Dawi, for it was the Greenskins -along with fell underground allies - that drove the descendants of King Lunn from Karak Eight Peaks, a Greathold whose majesty was eclipsed only by Everpeak itself. The entire Angrund Clan can trace their lineage back to King Lunn and all become outraged at the thought of those dark times.\n\nKing Belegar Ironhammer lives with this rage on a daily basis. He is the True King of Eight Peaks and his Clan's goal is to inhabit their mighty Dwarfhold once more. Even now, wherever Ironhammer holes up, trouble with the Greenskins seems to follow. Since the Chaos Moon arose, weeks prior, the raids have dramatically increased. It is not just Skarsnik's minions alone that attack - a new green-skinned enemy has entered the fray. Belegar orders his throng forth, as it is better to meet this fresh threat head on than hide meekly behind the barricades.	true

He brazenly enters the Black Council’s chamber and approaches the obsidian table – where the Witch King sits with his most loyal advisors – proclaiming that he knows the Supreme Spellshield’s whereabouts and will share it for a price. In the chamber sit a hundred Lords, none of whom can remember such an audacious attempt to provoke the Witch King; many see Strenious’ life lasting only seconds more!\n\nYet Malekith does not unleash his legendary rage.

Malekith makes a great show of thanking the Captain, and pays him then and there. As Strenious smiles upon the wealth he’s suddenly accumulated, the Witch King grabs the captain by the throat and casually throws him over the side of the great vessel. His fortune follows him into the sea, for Malekith cares not for riches, it is power he has always craved.\n\nStrenious’ crew do not bat an eyelid at their master’s sudden death, but quickly make themselves busy when the Witch King orders his army disembarked for an expedition to retrieve the lost shield.	true

A great Orc Warboss has arisen somewhere in the lands south of the Black Mountains. His fearsome reputation has gathered many Greenskin tribes behind him in a Waaagh! which is now headed for the main route from the Badlands into the Empire: Black Fire Pass. The first priority is to prevent further Orc warbands from travelling to join the Waaagh! Meanwhile, messengers are sent to summon all allies to face this threat.	true

He cannot be allowed to succeed.

She must make ready there.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc07_qb_brt_fay_enchantress_chalice_of_potions_stage_6	The dark and prophetic visions that plagued the Fay Enchantress have at last come to pass. Dark clouds gather off the northern shore of Bretonnia, and reports reach Couronne of a fleet, manned by servants of the Ruinous Powers in numbers beyond counting. They are so many, it is as if a great cloak is reaching across the ocean. Panic grips the people, but the Enchantress remains calm.\n\nUpon the shores, she grasps the Chalice of Potions and channels its power in the name of the Lady. The ritual draws power from the swirling and tumultuous Winds of Magic, conjuring a dark and vicious storm. Bolts of lightning arc down at the approaching fleet, dashing them to pieces, whilst winds of enormous magnitude hurl yet more ships away to a watery demise. The spell is beyond anything ever seen before, and far greater than the one in the Enchantress' vision. When it is done, most of the fleet is consigned to oblivion. Yet despite it all, more advance. A sizeable force lands upon Bretonnian shores, still intent on seeing the land burn.\n\nThe Enchantress knows what must be done. These remnants must be faced, they must be fought and, finally, they must be utterly crushed.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc07_qb_brt_fay_enchantress_chalice_of_potions_stage_1	In her dreams, the Fay Enchantress sees what has been, what is, and what may yet be. She stands upon the coastline and watches as an endless fleet of ships, seething with the servants of Chaos, crashes through the waves towards Bretonnian shores. With the power of her Chalice of Potions, the Enchantress summons forth a storm of unseen enormity upon the approaching fleet. Yet though many of them are sent to calamitous, watery graves, even that cannot stop all the invaders. Still they come, the very sea seeming to boil and froth beneath their prows; an invasion without end, a fight without hope. As they pour from their vessels onto the land, unstoppable, the Ruinous hordes seem intent to rip the very heart from the breast of Bretonnia...\n\nThe Fay Enchantress awakes with a start, a deep fear settling, ice cold, within her. She knows, in this moment, that this was no mere nightmare but a vision - sent by the Lady - of what could be, should her strength be insufficient to stop it. The Enchantress knows what must be done, and knows there is very little time in which to do it.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc07_qb_brt_fay_enchantress_chalice_of_potions_stage_2	Through days of ceaseless toil and mind-wearying study, the Enchantress discovers rituals that may yield the answers she seeks, rituals that could make her potions strong enough to stop the Chaos invasion from her vision. Yet as is to be expected, the rituals are by no means simple; the Chalice must be charged by three rituals, all of which must triangulate with it from precise locations. The first point of the ritual lies in Nordland, to the east, far across the marches and into the lands of the Empire of Man. Knowing that time is crucial, and that Chaos grows ever-nearer, she dispatches a faithful servant to Nordland to begin the ritual.	true

Yet it is a weak thing, dim and guttering; the Enchantress knows there is much more to be done, and the hour is growing late. Even now, she can feel the dark forces at play, threatening to overpower the world itself. The next ritual location plunges deep into the heart of that darkness - atop the gnarled peaks of the Vanaheim Mountains; the very heart of enemy territory. Yet the Fay Enchantress knows that she cannot relent; the tribes surrounding the mountains must be quashed, and the ritual began in relative safety.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_main_dwf_thorgrim_grudgebearer_axe_of_grimnir_stage_1	The Engineers' Guild have some new designs for an exciting improvement to the Gyrocopter, which would allow for increased speed and lifting capacity. These dark times call for a departure from the Dwarfs' customary adherence to tradition and suspicion of anything 'new'. Though these plans have been only half a century in the making, almost an insult to the Ancestors in their hasty preparation, the Guild has decided to bring them to Thorgrim's attention, though the Guild hall has been the scene of lengthy and heated debate on the matter. Now a Master Engineer has been tasked with producing the final technical drawings and prototypes before production can begin. However, the experimental processes involved will require further investment in the Guild's workshops, and this will not come cheap.	true

It seems that the king’s army was scattered by a sudden sandstorm, and slain by a horde of Greenskins. The Greenskin Warboss, Grudsnik, stripped the king's corpse of the magnificent armour. The spirit knows no more, and Count Mannfred releases it. The name of Grudsnik is known to the Vampire Lord. Grudsnik da Magnificent was once the scourge of Bretonnia. Such was his reputation that his followers built a great burial mound for him protected by Shamanic fetishes.

Alberic has heard of the roaming brigands that plague Estalia, but he had no idea they were so personally committed to his own misfortune.

His anger rises - who would dare rob the White Dwarf of Greenskins to slay?\n\nThe answer comes quickly. Sat on a pile of Orc corpses, drinking ale from a fine horn is a half-naked Dwarf sporting a massive slice of crescent-shaped hair, it is none other than Gotrek Gurnisson! The Slayer nods a greeting as Grombrindal sits down beside him. Gotrek offers the horn, and the White Dwarf drinks mightily - although it is a thirst not truly earned. The two legends share a few words, and Gotrek makes to leave soon after, for he has an umgi poet to find. He does offer some sage advice before disappearing into the night: the Warboss at the centre of this Waaagh! is gathering together a mighty horde of monsters. Gurnisson suggests he recruit a  group of Slayers he can vouch for. Gotrek would join himself, but this umgi partner of his seems to be missing and no doubt needs to rescued.\n\nThe meeting of two great Dawi heroes ends, and Grombrindal sets out to find the Slayers.	true

The Cult of Sigmar have caught wind of Ghorst's search as, after all, the Necromancer wasn't very subtle in burning down Empire settlements. The Sigmarites are now searching for the last remaining pages to keep them out of Ghorst's, and ultimately Mannfred's, hands. They have tracked the pages to a site deep within the Border Princes - taken there by a Lahmian cult centuries ago, placed in a sealed casket and thrown in a deep gorge to keep them out of Nagash's necrotic hands. Burning the pages would have proved more effective, but many counter-curses ensure the Books of Nagash cannot be so easily destroyed.\n\nAnd so the Cult of Sigmar control the site, hunting for the casket. Ghorst needs the location. The Vampire gives him a redolent smile, stating that while the whereabouts remain a mystery to her, she is aware of a ranking officer that does know. Getting the information from a single Empire soldier shouldn't be too taxing, as will killing him afterwards to ensure his silence. He can then join Ghorst's brothers on the cart!	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc04_vmp_helman_ghorst_liber_noctus_stage_1	The Plague of Blue Roses is a vile disease, sadly common throughout the southern provinces and Tilea. Once its spores have been inhaled, mortal men will quickly perish in a matter of hours, the tell-tale bluish fungus bruises covering their bodies. So it was that a young Helman Ghorst discovered his father and four brothers lying in their beds, taken by the Plague. In a fit of anguish, Helman embraced his dead kin - desperate to contract the plague himself - but fate had other plans for the youngest of the Ghorst family.\n\nUnable to accept his family's deaths, Ghorst sought other, darker means to bring them back. Years later, Helman crossed paths with Mannfred. The Vampire Count saw something in Ghorst, a potential ally perhaps? To that end, he gave Ghorst the Liber Noctus, the Cursed Book of Necromancy. Yet the pages of greatest lore were missing - torn from their binding and scattered across the Empire. No doubt this was Mannfred's true agenda all along - a test - and should Ghorst be successful, he would imbue one of the nine Books of Nagash with great power once more.\n\nGhorst must begin the hunt for the missing pages immediately or risk disappointing the Gravelord, Mannfred, himself. Fast-moving Dire Wolves will allow the Necromancer to cover more ground.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_great_vortex_lzd_tiktaqto_mask_of_heavens_mp	Having felt the power of his Mask of Heavens fading, Tiktaq’to had an inkling that something was amiss. So Hexoatl’s greatest Terradon Rider, the legendary Master of Skies, set out to search for the cause of the disturbance atop his fearsome mount, Zwup. He had first sensed the problem upon his arrival in the Southlands, which led him to conclude that something somewhere on the continent must have been causing it.\n\nSoaring above the vast and immense jungles, Tiktaq’to searched for an explanation through the dense jungle canopy and eventually spotted vermin-like footprints on the ground below. Upon closer inspection, and utilising his highly-developed reptilian senses, he caught the distinct stench of the ratmen’s fear-musk still hanging in the humid air – the Skaven were nearby, and there had to be a link between their presence and the continued weakening of his ancient, revered artefact. After further tracking and skirmishes with small bands of Skavenslaves, Tiktaq’to and his Terradon Riders learnt of an even larger Skaven presence in the jungle. Worse still, they were causing damage to the Geomantic Web through the desecration of the temple ruins in the area, likely whilst searching for the damnable Warpstone deposits.\n\nOnly the defiling activities of the despicable Skaven could’ve caused such local disruption to the Web, in turn explaining the weakening of the blessings upon Tiktaq’to’s Mask of Heavens. Now he has acquired this knowledge, there is little else to be done but head to their last known location and slaughter every last one of the blasphemous Skaven-spawn with extreme prejudice!	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_wulfrik_the_wanderer_sword_of_torgald_stage_3	Having arrived on Bretonnian soil, Wulfrik needs to gather the scent of his prey and draw him out of hiding. He knows that by ruthlessly and mercilessly pillaging the lands surrounding Bretonnia’s capital, he will have a good chance of attracting the horseman's attention. If he is as chivalrous and honourable as Wulfrik’s dreams had portrayed him to be, this warrior could surely not ignore such atrocities committed against his countrymen. Or if that doesn’t work, Wulfrik’s raiding party should at least be able to torture some useful information out of some poor peasant wretches! Wulfrik must now raise the raiding banner and begin a campaign of wicked despoilment.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_wulfrik_the_wanderer_sword_of_torgald_stage_2	Wulfrik gazes out at the twisted men and brutish beasts of his raiding party with a wry smile. It is truly a terrifying force of bloodthirsty killers, some of whom had already accompanied him across the world countless times before. All of them, however, have qualities that the great Norscan Worldwalker demands of all his followers – an inclination to perpetually murder and raid, and the dedication to loyally march with him as he seeks his challenges. With his warband now sufficiently bolstered with the deadliest killers in Norsca, it is time for him to set sail for the 'land of chivalry’.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_wulfrik_the_wanderer_sword_of_torgald_stage_1	Wulfrik is a cursed individual, for he is the ever-restless Eternal Challenger. Also known as the Worldwalker, he is forever compelled by the Dark Gods to wander the Old World in search of worthy opponents to fight to the death. Every Hero, champion, and monster who has heard the utterance of his undeniable challenge so far has fallen defeated before him, with their skulls taken as his trophies. And still, Wulfrik’s burning desire to engage in murderous single combat always remains unsated.\n\nAs they had so often done in the past, the Gods send Wulfrik a vision. In his dreams he sees the petty kingdom of men known as Bretonnia, where he glimpses a great and lauded hero atop a mighty charger, rescuing the weak and punishing the wicked. To Wulfrik’s delight, his vision shows the horseman to be completely drenched in blood – a sign that this formidable warrior is undoubtedly his next quarry. Such is this opponent’s worth, that Wulfrik anticipates the most glorious of duels culminating in his victory and a murderous offering that cannot go unnoticed by the Gods.\n\nTo draw the great hero out, Wulfrik must first have his warband raid and despoil in Bretonnia itself, by wreaking havoc and spilling the blood of innocents. Only the fiercest and most bloodthirsty of Norscan Marauders would be suitable for such work.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_wulfrik_the_wanderer_sword_of_torgald_stage_5	The keep in Lyonesse is likely to be heavily defended, but will surely yield considerable riches, enough to fuel Wulfrik's plundering warband for the many more sorties to come. More importantly, desecrating a site of such importance to Bretonnia will undoubtedly attract their toughest champions, and he expects one of them to be the horseman of his visions - the one he seeks to fight. It must be! Only by fulfilling the demands of his masters can Wulfrik be granted the dark rewards of power which he craves far more than mere material wealth. He raises his sword and the raiding banner once more. Let the slaughter commence!	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_wulfrik_the_wanderer_sword_of_torgald_stage_4	To Wulfrik’s frustration, his raiding foray has not been enough to draw the hero out, at least up to now. But as he skewers peasant after peasant at one of Couronne’s sacked farm estates, he stumbles upon a stroke of luck, as if placed before him by the Dark Gods themselves. One of the prisoners about to be painfully impaled hastily blurts out the existence of a small keep further down the coast in Lyonesse, which he swears will be of great interest to the giant warrior. With Wulfrik agreeing to spare him in return for more information, the peasant goes on to mention that this is no ordinary keep – it contains the remains of a long-dead Bretonnian King considered to be some of the holiest relics in the Kingdom, as well as a trove of precious jewels and other stately heirlooms of immeasurable value.\n\nWith quick perpendicular swipes of his massive sword, Wulfrik quarters the peasant into a bloody four-part mess before calling on his warband to immediately march south to the site of the keep. By attacking it, Wulfrik will surely get the great duel he so craves; it is inevitable!	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_vortex_noctilus_captain_roths_moondial_stage_2	Noctilus has always been one to hand-pick the highest-quality Undead servants to bolster his personal crew. One of the most morbid creations the Maelstrom can help to manifest is the Necrofex Colossus – a twisted amalgam of dead bodies fused with the timber and iron of sunken ships to create a monstrous humanoid giant. To wield such unholy power is to be feared in any battle, whether on land or at sea. Noctilus’ rise to power is nigh!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_vortex_noctilus_captain_roths_moondial_stage_3	Having put together a crew of unspeakable horrors, this is undoubtedly the time for Count Noctilus to act. But first, to ensure his supremacy over the seas stays unsurpassed, he must ensure that the Galleon’s Graveyard remains out of the reach of rival Necromancers also hoping to harness the boundless power emanating from the Maelstrom. Very few are able to find it without possessing very specific navigational knowledge, but one particular enchanted instrument makes it possible for even a novice to do so – Captain Roth’s Moondial. Captain Roth is a famous seafarer and native of Sartosa, known for being Noctilus’ one-time arch-rival. After one of Noctilus’ midnight raids led to the demise of Roth’s entire family, the anguished captain led a fleet directly to the Galleon’s Graveyard to avenge them, a navigational feat only made possible with his magical moondial. Neither Noctilus or Roth were defeated outright in the immense sea battle that ensued that day, but both suffered extensive casualties. The horrors Roth’s crew witnessed in the Galleon’s Graveyard pushed many of them to desertion following the battle. During the confusion, his moondial was opportunistically stolen, ensuring that the graveyard could never be easily found again.\nAs long as Captain Roth’s Moondial might still be out there, however, Noctilus’ dominance over the seas will always be under threat. The Count senses that other Necromancers must be searching for the moondial, intending to find the Galleon’s Graveyard and use the Maelstrom themselves. There’s no time to waste – he must now begin a campaign of raiding to find it himself, and with any luck he'll uncover the device before they do.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_vortex_noctilus_captain_roths_moondial_stage_1	Count Noctilus is well aware of the raw power he can draw from the Galleon’s Graveyard. Having translocated himself and his castle there many years ago, it is a place close to his cold, dead heart, a place where he is able to exert an incredible level of Necromantic control over both the dead and inanimate objects. Indeed, it was in the Galleon’s Graveyard that he forged his floating castle known as the Bloody Reaver from the wreckage of sunken war galleons and set out to dominate the Great Ocean. To help his deathly enterprise, more powerful minions will need to be added to the Undead backbone of Noctilus’ pirate empire. The Maelstrom – the skull-strewn vortex located at the centre of the Galleon’s Graveyard, drawing the dead unto itself like a giant lodestone – must be stoked into a more active state before he can raise them.	true

Finally, following a boarding action against an Empire trading vessel daring to cross the Great Ocean, a clue is found – a map, supposedly leading to a treasure chest in which the moondial was last seen.\nNoctilus examines the map closely. He feels like he is looking at one of his own traps, but nothing is going to get in his way. The map might lead him to the moondial, or perhaps to someone who knows where it is. In any case, Noctilus will crush anyone who opposes him!	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_objective_alarielle_05	At the heart of Ulthuan lies the Vortex, a dimensional rift that, through the actions of the High Elves, holds the world together.

missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_skv_skrolk_rod_of_corruption_stage_3	Lord Skrolk has discovered what the Lizardmen hide and the thing that he seeks - the power to befoul metal and restore the Rod of Corruption. To the north of Lustria lies the Island of the Crimson Skull; it is the Skull itself that Skrolk seeks, as it is made from a unique mineral that can be powdered into a red oxidising material that eats iron and steel. Once spread upon the Rod of Corruption, Skrolk’s weapon will be powerful once again. Then he can return to his grand schemes.\n\nFirst, he must deal with the Council while the Great Vortex remains unstable, but that is what this lick-spittle scribe is for. Let the Council be distracted by this scheme, so Skrolk can plan his ascension to Arch-Plaguelord without interference.	true

Back in Skavenblight, Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch tuts at Skrolk’s performance, but still the Lizardmen must pay the price. But Lord Skrolk is more cunning than most. To outsiders he may seem to be lashing out, but those who know Skrolk know there is method in his fury. The Lizardmen hide knowledge; they have many secrets and one is the power to eat metal. Once he is rid of the reptiles, he will scour their plaques with eyes that cannot see until he finds out how to restore the Rod of Corruption.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_skv_skrolk_rod_of_corruption_stage_1	Skrolk’s deadly rod has been at his side for the many decades the Plaguelord has walked the world. It is said that the rod was awarded to Skrolk in the wake of his blindness. When he clawed at his own eyes after bearing witness to Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch, Skrolk wished no other vision to obscure that glimpse of pestilent perfection.\n\nDespite this, Nurglitch does not brook failure, and remains unimpressed with Skrolk’s performance since the Vortex became vulnerable. Matters are not helped by the Rod of Corruption’s recent inability to cast rust upon metal. Flesh will still slough from bones when struck, but where before metal would oxidise and corrode, it remains gleaming. Skrolk suspects that the recent Vortex activity and his rod’s lack of corruption are linked, but first he must appease the Arch-Plaguelord and bolster Clan Pestilens' forces.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_main_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_axe_of_dargo_stage_3	Having consulted with his Guild, the Runesmith reports that the missing runes are amongst those whose mysteries have been lost to the Dwarfs for centuries. However, the Guild’s council suspects that in revealing its song to Ungrim, the axe is attempting to make itself whole once more, seeking the aid of Ungrim’s kindred warrior soul to do so. By wholly aligning his spirit with the axe in the crucible of battle, the Slayer King may be able to provide the counterpoint to mend the blade’s song. Such perfection of alignment is more likely to be achieved in a high place, closer to the Ancestor gods, and against an adversary of great skill in battle-craft. In his many hours of contemplation before the Slayer Shrine, Ungrim catches a gossamer thread of song coming from the north. Rising, he orders the horns sounded to summon his throng.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_main_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_axe_of_dargo_stage_2	Ungrim kneels before the Slayer Shrine once more, fingering his notched axe as his battle rage cools. In his last battle, a reverie came upon him again. Whilst in the midst of slaying, he felt a discordant note amongst the otherwise perfect rhythm of battle. Contemplation brought him to the realisation that his own axe was the source of the disharmony. Reforged from the shattered remnants of the az of the first Slayer King, it is missing a section which has been replaced with Gromril. Though Gromril weapons are amongst the most deadly in the Old World, the replacement section is blank, lacking the runes of power that are etched into the rest of the blade. The secrets of many of the ancient runes of power have been lost over the millennia but the axe is not whole and the missing runes must somehow be reforged if the weapon is to sing true once more. Ungrim summons a Runesmith to discuss the matter.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_main_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_axe_of_dargo_stage_1	Ungrim Ironfist, the Slayer King of Karak Kadrin is a restless Dwarf. His five-time great grandsire suffered a terrible loss and in his torment swore the Oath of Slayers. This vow to seek out death conflicted with his vow as king to protect his people. In the end, good Dwarf sense prevailed and he found a way to honour all commitments by founding the Slayer Shrine of Karak Kadrin, establishing a haven for Slayers that continues to this day. Now Ungrim, bound by the same oaths, spends many hours before the shrine, chafing at his fate. Though he cannot seek death himself, he can certainly seek out opportunities to slay the enemy, and it is this that affords him a modicum of solace.	true

Vlad has already decided on a target, he will strike where he did once before; Ostermark sits ripe and plump like a suckling pig basting over a hot fire. It is ready to be consumed...	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_tehenhauin_lord_kroak_stage_2	Unfortunately, it appears that the Lord Kroak was roused from his slumber far too early; not enough time had passed since his previous awakening, so he remains in a semi-dream state.

However, in their haste it would appear that the scouts were somewhat careless, as they have been followed to Kroak’s location by a force of those insidious ratmen, the Skaven! They plan to destroy him, once and for all, by incinerating his physical remains that anchor him to the world. This must not come to pass – defend Kroak from harm whilst his priests awaken him!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_tehenhauin_lord_kroak_stage_1	Lord Kroak is one of the First Generation of Slann Mage-Priests, and possibly the eldest, making him one of the most powerful active creatures of any race. He has an added advantage, however, in that he is technically dead; Kroak’s mortal body was killed during the Great Catastrophe but his remains were preserved by loyal Skink attendants, enabling him to re-emerge as the first Relic Priest. Due to his death, Kroak’s meditative cycles are significantly longer than those of younger Slann. An elder Slann must be awakened to reveal his last known location as, simply put, no one else is old enough to remember!	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_def_lokhir_red_blades_stage_1	Lokhir’s famed dual swords, the Red Blades, have slain many foes for the Corsair King. However, the power imbued within them, drawn from the Indan God Gilgadresh’s statue, is failing. The only way to restore the blades to their former state is to regularly gorge them with blood – but not just any blood, for only the blood of the most anguished victims will sate them.\n\nFor Lokhir, Karond Kar is an obvious target of conquest for these ends – also known as ‘Slaver’s Gate’, it is home to many slaves living the final minutes, hours, or days of their pitiful lives as miserable drudges. The readily-available blood of these thralls, downtrodden then sacrificed, shall be more than enough to slake the Red Blades once again!	true

There is much spittle-flecked talk of lakes of blood, crystalline butterflies, gardens of rot and so on. Sigvald finds his attention wandering to a complacent consideration of the perfection in his own immaculately manicured hand. However, his attention snaps back to the Sorcerer when the man’s meanderings touch upon a great Lord in shining baroque armour of ensorcelled gold, forever untarnished by age or the tiniest fleck of dirt and surrounded by warm perfumed air, even on the snowy plain across which he marches at the head of a great Chaos host. The ground reshapes itself to let the warrior pass, and his feet float an inch above the world’s surface so that his boots are never touched by the mud or gore of the battlefield. There follows some babbling about the defensive properties of this wondrous mail, but Sigvald hears none of it as he curtly orders the Sorcerer forth to investigate.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_main_liz_kroq_gar_hand_of_gods_stage_2	Lord Mazdamundi wishes to grant Kroq-Gar use of a revered artefact, the Hand of the Gods. Kroq-Gar’s service to Lizard-kind is beyond counting, yet the Saurus must still prove himself worthy of the mantle and ensure his own thoughts align with Mazdamundi’s xenophobic interpretation of the Great Plan.\n\nA few leagues from the Hexoatl, the City of the Sun, Elven servants of Ulthuan interfere with the Fallen Gates - an ancient portal of the Old Ones. Their intention may be honourable, but they cannot be allowed to tamper with mechanisms far beyond their limited understanding. The Asur must be stopped before their meddling summons something far more dangerous.\n\nKroq-Gar stands ready, but Mazdamundi counsels that a larger cohort is needed to face the Elves.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_main_liz_kroq_gar_hand_of_gods_stage_3	The Fallen Gates are a cosmic device of the Old Ones, a stellar bridge that once reached across the stars to who-knows-where.

Nevertheless, when a summons comes from Lord Mazdamundi, the oldest and most powerful of all living Mage-Priests, Kroq-Gar is duty-bound to answer.\n\nThe command from Mazdamundi is weak, no doubt a result of the Great Warding’s disintegration, which in turn is due to the fading Vortex on the High Elf Isle of Ulthuan. The ancient Saurus decides that a Skink must tap into the Geomantic Web directly, to clarify Mazdamundi’s directive.	true

When the weight of his fury becomes too great to bear, he often descends to the vaults to seek solace amongst the riches heaped there. But gold itself presents another means to achieve vengeance, and as such a king can never have enough of it.

Old enemies prey upon the trade caravans, butchering the traders and plundering their wealth. Of late, no caravan has made it through the ill-omened province of Sylvania. Whilst it's true that there are other routes into the Empire, the Sylvanian route offers certain advantages, and besides, there are fresh scores to be settled.

Some boyz wanted to query Wurrzag about it, but none dare enter his hovel, for to disturb him would surely invite great doom.\n\nDa Prophet finally emerged from his ramshackle hut, pulling away the fetid hide that covered the doorway, revealing himself to the tribe. The Greenskins gathered, keen to hear what da Godz' desire. According to Wurrzag, it is to Blackfire Pass they must go, and the Shaman in the prophet’s vision is, of course, Wurrzag himself, imbued with power from Mork’s breath. The prophet immediately dispatches one of his most trusted disciples to Blackfire Pass, to make sure the humies or the stunties aren’t camping in it to cause Wurrzag bother.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_grn_wurrzag_da_great_green_prophet_bonewood_staff_stage_2	As Wurrzag’s influence spreads towards the petty fiefs of the Border Princes, the Shaman has another vision. Once more he sees that mountain pass of light and dark, fire and blackness. At its centre stands a Shaman, waving a staff of bone, green energy channelling through the staff, coruscating around the Orc and flooding into the creature’s eyes. Who is this Shaman? A threat or an ally?\n\nAnswers must be sought, but they will not be found on the battlefield or in the razed towns of the humies. Wurrzag needs a special space to commune with his masters and seek further understanding.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_grn_wurrzag_da_great_green_prophet_bonewood_staff_stage_1	When the Green Godz call upon their prophet they care not for the Shaman’s availability, whether he’s visiting da dropz, in the middle of a battle or simply prancing around the campfire. When Gork or Mork calls, Wurrzag will fall into a trance that can last minutes, hours, even days!\n\nWurrzag has fallen into such a trance. Luckily he was nowhere near da drops, but in the midst of chomping on a Snotling when a particularly powerful vision struck. All night, Wurrzag remained silent and still, the half-eaten Snotling frantically trying to prise the Savage Orc’s jaws apart. When the Shaman came to, and finally emptied his mouth with a big gulp, he immediately gathered the tribe and told them of what he had seen. It was a vision of confusing sights - blood and death, ruined Dwarf Halls, a group of smug humie adventurers, and a mountain passage of black rock and fire.\n\nMost Orcs look confused, but Wurrzag is enthused with a sense of purpose. While not entirely sure what that exact purpose is, he is convinced that the lands before the Black Mountains should be taken in Gork's… or Mork’s name.	true

Even if it doesn’t, at least you will get the opportunity to pillage the dwellings of those estranged forest people!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_6_stage_1	Mammoths are important tools of war for the northern tribes, and highly valued for sacrifice to the Dark Gods.

He tells you that he experienced a single blow from the great monster which had caused him to lose his arm, then he was struck by one of the many bolts of lightning falling from the sky, which grazed the side of his head and burnt one of his eyes out of his very skull.\n\nThe legendary beast must exist, for the proof of it stands right there in front of you. But now you must see for yourself. The slave gives you the likely location of where the beast was headed after obliterating his tribe – the Chaos Wastes.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_5_stage_3	It seems that Radixashen is not interested in coming to his ally's aid on this occasion. Perhaps it wrongly assumed that they were able enough to repel your attack, but in any case, further despoilment of the forest will be needed to bait the creature. You know that there is a great tree of immense spiritual importance to the forest, located right at its heart. Known as the Oak of Ages, not only is it considered the source of the forest’s power, but is also the annual birthplace of their King in the Woods. Surely, the Serpent of the World Roots cannot ignore the desecration of such a revered and important location. It is time to raise the raiding banners!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_7_stage_1	Soaring above the eldritch plains of Sylvania there exists a rare species of gargantuan bat-like monster that is as giant and powerful as the largest of dragons. They are known as Terrorgheists, flying nocturnal beasts of rotten flesh and withered organs exposed to the night air. Although most are guided by the will of their evil masters, some Terrorgheists are more self-serving, drawing their power and evil intent from the very soil of their Undead homeland. It is said that to bring down such a beast takes the greatest of hunters. This sounds like just the kind of sacrifice that would be seen very favourably by the Gods!\n\nThere is one ancient Terrorgheist known to be more terrifying than all others, with a scream that is said to break the will of any man, and eyes like black holes that suck in all manner of magical energies and light. It is known as the Abyssal Shrieker, an abominable Terrorgheist spoken about only in nightmarish tales shrouded in myth, the fragments of truth of which are unknown to most.\n\nIt would certainly be foolish to enter into this hunt with no knowledge of the bounty, so before setting off to find the monster, you call upon one most likely to have knowledge of the Old World’s ancient beasts – a Shaman-Sorcerer.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_4_stage_1	The Greenskins are famous for having all manner of monstrosities in their despicable ranks, including the lumbering Giants that follow them to insatiably feast in battle. Killing one for sacrifice would bring great prestige and recognition from the Gods, for what can be more impressive than slaying a legendary descendant of the long-forgotten Sky-Titans?\n\nYou have heard of one very belligerent Giant called Blorgar the Mad Titan, who is lumbering around the Grey Mountains being more than just a minor nuisance to the locals there. Setting out to slay the leviathan, you expect that the locals having their lands indiscriminantly flattened will be quite happy to see you, but it matters little. You're not going there to kill it for their sake – the hunt is on!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_6_stage_3	You have gathered information that a large Dwarf expedition has just departed to hunt down the herd. The Dwarfs’ involvement is an interesting development, since they are not known to be avid monster hunters, nor are they known to use mammoths in their battle-ranks as the northern tribes do. There must be good a reason for them to have left the safety of their holds just to hunt down some belligerent beasts. They were last seen marching for Kislev, so some further reconnaissance will be needed.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_7_stage_2	Delving into his vast collection of tomes and scrolls, the Shaman reveals that any records which might have mentioned the Abyssal Shrieker were so ancient that they are lost in the streams of time. With no hint as to where the monster’s lair could be, its very existence is in question. At the very least the Shaman is able to tell you that he knows Terrorgheists to be deeply bound to necromancy in the Sylvanian lands, and one particular Sylvanian family is known to be frequently mentioned in some records as having hunted the terrible beasts in the past. It’s not much to go on, but it’s a start. You must search out any remnants of this family in the lands of Sylvania.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_0_stage_4	Just as you start to think that you are losing the Frost-Wyrm’s trail, the extreme weather around The Tower of Khrakk mysteriously dies down.

This can be no coincidence – you must make your way into old Troll Country!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_1_stage_5	The Shaman returns and discloses his simple but deviously grim plan. Having communed with various godlings and daemons in his mysterious rituals, he now claims to know the location of the Soul-Eaters. He suggests you march your army to the edge of the Forest of Shadows, taking captive any men you can capture on the way – and keep them alive. This plan sounds like it is getting interesting...	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_5_stage_1	Forest Dragons are truly remarkable creatures, dominating the forests as all dragons dominate their habitats. For most, stepping into the woods to find one to slay is either an act of extreme bravery or hopeless stupidity, such is the fiercely protective nature of the beings who dwell there. To some, the elusive Wood Elves are as dangerous as the unpredictable Beastmen, both of whom may attack unprovoked if you trespass into their woodland territories.\n\nSomewhere in the trees and thickets of Athel Loren lives Radixashen, also known as the Serpent of the World Roots. It is thought to be as ancient as the forest itself, and for that, it is a highly prized bounty for sacrifice. As with all dragons, it will be very difficult to track down and kill. The first thing you must do is to travel to the famous forest of the Wood Elves.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_6_stage_2	Arriving in the mountains of Hel, the elephantine beasts are nowhere to be found. Instead, it seems that there are several Dwarf warriors to the area, namely Slayers and Rangers. Clearly, they too are hunting this herd, but you can’t be sure of their motives. The nearest Dwarfholds are in the nearby Gianthome Mountains – go there and squeeze some information out of them!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_7_stage_3	After a short stint of raiding around Sylvanian lands, you come across an old manor known to be the former home of the Sylvanian family you seek. The house is lifeless – the line of nobility that used to live there had long ended, leaving only howling ghosts of the past that scatter into the shadows as you arrive. Searching every room, you come across a study with an old skeleton sat at a desk, a quill still in its hand. On the table is a leather-bound notebook containing a written history of the family who once lived there.\n\nAccording to the notebook, the former inhabitants of the house were once nobles of nearby Stirland, which was frequently haunted by The Abyssal Shrieker. The skeleton sat at the table was, in fact, a former Stirlander Lord, a renowned hunter who had once attempted to kill the exceptionally dangerous centuries-old monster himself. After a vicious battle, the great Lord failed to slay the beast and narrowly escaped with his life. Although he survived the encounter, he paid a terrible price for his defeat. The Terrorgheist absorbed almost all of his life-force and strength to make itself even more powerful, leaving the once-great hunter a sickly, weak individual, an affliction that infected his entire family and bloodline. Withered and disgraced, the noble and his kin exiled themselves to Sylvania where they eventually perished in shame.\n\nClearly, this pathetic Stirlander was nowhere near as great a hunter as you! He at least managed to record the location of his defeat, which you assume to be in the vicinity of the Abyssal Shrieker’s lair. All that remains to do is travel to Wurtbad to find it.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_0_stage_3	There are few individuals as hardened and adept on the freezing tundra than the bloodthirsty Marauder Hunters.

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_1_stage_2	Your hunters send word that they have not been able to find any leads in the forests, but have caught wind of a pair of sieging Cygors terrorizing Middenland, hurling giant boulders that are turning castle walls to rubble. It’s as good a lead as any and surely the soft southerners are not going to last long anyway, so they could do with a plundering. Time to bring some real hunters to the lands of men!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_2_stage_1	Dragon Ogres are living legends of carnage and destruction. Most of what the Norscans know of these god-like beasts of Chaos is from the ancient records kept by their Shamans, which has immortalised them in folklore. Amongst the more ancient tribes there survives tales of one exceptionally strong Dragon Ogre Shaggoth known as Traygard Mountain-Cleaver. His power is thought to be second only to Kholek Suneater himself, with the ability to call upon thousands of thunder bolts to rain down on his victims, striking from unpredictable arcs to maim and destroy on his whim. Traygard is indeed an excellent target for a hunt – to sacrifice such a powerful and ancient monster of Chaos would be seen very favourably by the Gods. However, the monstrous Shaggoth hasn’t been seen in centuries, or at least, nobody has witnessed him and lived to tell the tale in that time. \n\nNews arrives of rumours that Traygard may be active again. A Norscan tribe to the north-east, very close to the Chaos Wastes, has been burnt to the ground with almost their entire enclave of warriors slaughtered in a single night. It is certainly true that many tribes of the north frequently perish at the hands of rival warring tribes, but on the night this tribe fell, it is said that a thunderstorm as bright as day lit up the night sky.\n\nThis is certainly worth investigation, but you first need more information, preferably from the survivors who actually witnessed the slaughter. With the majority of the tribe dead, this is easier said than done – the few surviving tribesmen are scattered as nomads throughout the region. The hunt is on.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_1_stage_3	You tear through Middenheim, leaving charred villages and slaughtered townspeople in your wake. Not only is there no sign of the Cygor brothers, but the soft fools of the Empire are surprisingly unknowledgeable about these monsters that are supposedly terrorizing their lands. But not all hope is lost – one of your Shamans comes to you, claiming to have a plan which will lead you to your bounty. He can put this plan into action for you, but only for a handsome price of course. You'll need to fill your coffers!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_3_stage_1	It is no exaggeration that very few things truly scare the Northmen and the other abominable inhabitants of the north – least of all, spiders. However, when they take the form of Venom Queens, gigantic in size and made up for in numbers by their hatchling swarms, most would prefer not to face one. The only real upside of encountering a Venom Queen is that there are rarely more than one in any one place at a time – killing just one is hard enough!\n\nRecently, harrowing stories have started circulating that gigantic Venom Queens are grouping into vast spider swarms in the lands to the south. The most recent spate of appearances have been in the Eastern Badlands, where they have taken over swathes of land, devouring any who come near. To most, this would be terrifying news. But to the hunter, this is a prime opportunity for a worthy sacrifice! Time to get more information.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_0_stage_1	With the appearance of giant, winged monsters, Frost-Wyrms are thought to be a type of Chaos-mutated dragon that dwells in the underground passageways of the Old World’s coldest climes. Amongst the northern tribes there are tales of one such monstrous Frost-Wyrm called Frigustrex, Scion of the Cold-Void, that has terrorized the tundra for centuries. Witnesses say that when it comes out of hibernation, it emerges from the ground in a heartbeat to indiscriminately devour all unknowing passers-by who get too close to its territory, located somewhere at the frozen northern end of Troll Country.\n\nRecently, The Tower of Khrakk and the surrounding areas north of Troll Country have been inexplicably blanketed by freakishly bad snow storms. Word also reaches you that entire tribes have disappeared from the region without a trace, reportedly perishing in the extreme weather. This is highly unusual – it is not like the hardy Northmen to succumb to the freezing elements so easily. A more likely explanation is brought to you by a few survivors who managed to escape the storm – they say that it was not the icy weather that swallowed their fellow tribesmen up, but a giant dragonish shadow lurking in the blinding blizzard.\n\nIf there is even the slightest chance that the fabled Frigustrex is out of hibernation and on the prowl, then further investigation is warranted. This could end up being a bountiful hunt indeed!	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_3_stage_2	As you arrive in the Eastern Badlands, you immediately see that the rumours of the spider infestation are true. The land is blanketed in webs and cocoons, and the surface seems devoid of other life. You have also arrived at a time of conflict between the Dwarfs and the Greenskins, who are currently fighting a bitter subterranean war over the many underground strongholds protecting the lucrative mines in the area. You can hear the faint sound of cannons and warfare emanating from the ground beneath.\n\nYou have no interest in this silly war between the stunties and the grobi! Besides, the men and creatures of the north are not adept at digging and navigating tunnels, preferring to fight out in the open like real men. Fortunately, the Greenskins still have several camps on the surface where it should be possible to obtain more information about the Venom Queen infestation. There won't be time for diplomacy, however!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_1_stage_1	The Ruinous Masters have many worshippers across the Old World, amongst which the Beastmen are the most primitive. The influence of Chaos only enhances their bestial aspects, making the already-monstrous beasts larger and even more terrifying than they already are. One such pair of one-eyed abominations of the Beastmen are the gargantuan Cygor brothers known to men as The Salzenmund Soul-Eaters. These grotesque leviathans are not only bigger, stronger, and faster than their ordinary counterparts, but are feared even by Beastmen Bray-Shamans due to their ability to dampen the use of magic for others in their presence. To take on the mighty Soul-Eaters with limited use of magic certainly makes for a challenging hunt, but one which will potentially culminate in an impressive sacrifice to the Gods.\n\nFirst you must find the pair of monsters, who are always found together; a surprisingly difficult task considering their immense size. Being of the Beastmen, the Soul-Eaters dwell deep in the dark forests, navigable via the vast network of Beastpaths known only to the Beastmen themselves. The only way to safely explore them is to recruit some experienced hunters to search the woods thought to harbour Beastmen herds to hopefully find the Cygor brothers you seek as your bounty. 	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_3_stage_3	While sacking a Greenskin camp, you manage to capture a spineless Goblin attempting to scurry away from the area unseen. The cowardly wretch says he’ll give up some information about the Venom Queen infestation for a little ‘compensation’. But there are cheaper ways to get information out of a greedy Goblin! Taking a full three seconds of a beating before spitting out the information, he reveals that Skarsnik, the self-proclaimed ‘Warlord of Eight Peaks’ had recently discovered this group of larger, poisonous Arachnaroks, and had been trying to herd them for use in his own malevolent schemes. However, he could not control the uncontrollable swarm and it had moved on, thought to have gone underground via a nearby tunnel.\n\nYou need to find the location of this tunnel entrance. To do so, the area around Karak Eight Peaks will need to be turned upside down.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_main_def_malekith_destroyer_stage_1	Destroyer was forged by the Witch King himself, as a symbol of his determination to rid the world of High Elven kin. The touch of the Destroyer is especially potent against mages. It is a momentous piece of weapon-smithing and yet it has never been blessed by the Elven Maker-God, Vaul.\n\nMalekith considers it a great insult that the god has not deigned to heap praise upon him for his great work. The Witch King, while brooding about this, decides to salve his mood with an outing…	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc01_chs_archaon_armour_of_morkar_stage_2	As Archaon marches across the surreal wastes, flanked by the Swords of Chaos, his elite guard, he is driven on by a remorseless maxim which beats at his consciousness: strength begets strength! Rare is the man who rises, or falls, to the station of a Chaos Lord. Nevertheless, some have, and each represents a challenge to Archaon, but the fallen Templar knows that all are the playthings of the Dark Gods and that only by amusing these all-powerful beings will he rise to dominance. Archaon resolves to build his strength for the Unholy Quests ahead, the trials of the Everchosen yet to come.	true

It is the most sacred of sites, and now the Witch King has it in his sights. With Destroyer in hand, he marches relentlessly upon Ulthuan’s shores, to the tip of the Dragon Spine Peninsula and into the volcano itself.

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc01_chs_archaon_armour_of_morkar_stage_1	The Realm of Chaos plays fast and loose with the concept of time... Once a devout and pure Templar Priest of Sigmar, Archaon searched ancient texts for the means to destroy Chaos, but his studies proved worse than futile. Uncovering a set of heretical manuscripts, he learned a terrible truth which drove him to an unquenchable fury. Rejecting his former gods, he swore himself to the service of Chaos instead. Tearing down the temple, Archaon vowed to become the scourge of the Empire. The scrolls contained details of several artefacts of power and of a great warrior who would win the items and gain the blessing of all the Ruinous Powers. Archaon has vowed to become this man, or die in the attempt. Having cut a bloody swathe across the Empire, he has entered the dreaded Chaos Wastes. Many lesser servants of Chaos have come to follow him, but now he searches for true Warriors of Chaos, sworn "Swords" to form the core of his forces and demonstrate his might.	true

Turning to his assistants, he draws his claw across his own throat in silent instruction; immediately, they move in to relieve the dying Lizardman of what little remains of his miserable life.

If successful, this scheme will deliver the added bonus of supplying Ikit with almost endless deposits of Warpstone to fuel further experiments back at his Forbidden Workshop. To better achieve his goal, Ikit now decides to construct a Warpstone beam to blast chunks from the Chaos Moon and guide them directly to their target.	true

He understands very well that direct confrontation with the Lizardmen is not viable, but wiping those tiresome toads from the face of the world has to remain the priority, as Ikit knows the Lizardmen are plotting the demise of all Skaven with equal vigour. He needs to find a way to weaken them before facing them in battle and fancies there will be no better way than corrupting their ‘blessed’ spawning pools. The location of these are of course unknown, but this doesn’t present much of a problem – the Chief Warlock Engineer isn’t above extracting the information he needs from enemy captives himself, when the need arises…	true

Ariel is no fool either, she knows Morghur better than any of his enemies, and has tracked him down. In her stead, she sends a champion, at the head of an Asrai host, to put an end to Morghur's dreams of destruction and return Athel Loren to 'peace'. This is but a fleeting hope, however, for Morghur will not suffer these forest folk to interrupt his desires. This champion will be eviscerated and returned to Ariel in a dozen Ruinous pieces, each more garishly transformed than the last.	true

Irritatingly, the ever-watchful Slann Astromancers must have spotted the blasted Warpstone closing in, for they are fully battle-ready, and a Skaven scouting party reports that additional reinforcements are already on their way. Collecting some of the pure, fallen Warpstone from the field, Ikit repairs his deadly Warp-lightning thrower, Storm Daemon, and steels himself for the fray. There’s nothing else for it – he must hold his ground and make use of the chaos caused by the storm to gain advantage on the battlefield.	true

The only chance of gaining any useful information of the Giant’s whereabouts lay with a Bretonnian herb collector who’d allegedly stumbled upon an underground lair while spelunking nearby.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_noctilus_captain_roths_moondial_stage_1	Count Noctilus is well aware of the raw power he can draw from the Galleon’s Graveyard. Having translocated himself and his castle there many years ago, it is a place close to his cold, dead heart, a place where he is able to exert an incredible level of Necromantic control over both the dead and inanimate objects. Indeed, it was in the Galleon’s Graveyard that he forged his floating castle known as the Bloody Reaver from the wreckage of sunken war galleons and set out to dominate the Great Ocean. To help his deathly enterprise, more powerful minions will need to be added to the Undead backbone of Noctilus’ pirate empire. The Maelstrom – the skull-strewn vortex located at the centre of the Galleon’s Graveyard, drawing the dead unto itself like a giant lodestone – must be stoked into a more active state before he can raise them.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_noctilus_captain_roths_moondial_stage_3	Having put together a crew of unspeakable horrors, this is undoubtedly the time for Count Noctilus to act. But first, to ensure his supremacy over the seas stays unsurpassed, he must ensure that the Galleon’s Graveyard remains out of the reach of rival Necromancers also hoping to harness the boundless power emanating from the Maelstrom. Very few are able to find it without possessing very specific navigational knowledge, but one particular enchanted instrument makes it possible for even a novice to do so – Captain Roth’s Moondial. Captain Roth is a famous seafarer and native of Sartosa, known for being Noctilus’ one-time arch-rival. After one of Noctilus’ midnight raids led to the demise of Roth’s entire family, the anguished captain led a fleet directly to the Galleon’s Graveyard to avenge them, a navigational feat only made possible with his magical moondial. Neither Noctilus or Roth were defeated outright in the immense sea battle that ensued that day, but both suffered extensive casualties. The horrors Roth’s crew witnessed in the Galleon’s Graveyard pushed many of them to desertion following the battle. During the confusion, his moondial was opportunistically stolen, ensuring that the graveyard could never be easily found again.\nAs long as Captain Roth’s Moondial might still be out there, however, Noctilus’ dominance over the seas will always be under threat. The Count senses that other Necromancers must be searching for the moondial, intending to find the Galleon’s Graveyard and use the Maelstrom themselves. There’s no time to waste – he must now begin a campaign of raiding to find it himself, and with any luck he'll uncover the device before they do.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_noctilus_captain_roths_moondial_stage_2	Noctilus has always been one to hand-pick the highest-quality Undead servants to bolster his personal crew. One of the most morbid creations the Maelstrom can help to manifest is the Necrofex Colossus – a twisted amalgam of dead bodies fused with the timber and iron of sunken ships to create a monstrous humanoid giant.

To the Hierophant's shock, the shelves around his bones are stacked with Mortuary Cult tomes! Have the Dark Elves truly been dabbling in the arts of resurrection? This demands further enquiry - Khatep must know more. An ancient map on the crumbling desk marks the location of a city - and a sister library...   	true

Khatep is staggered to find within its pages a new liturgy, capable of binding a soul to a living host. There is some risk to both participants, of course, but could this be the answer? A way to renew Settra - and others besides - to true life? Surely this would restore Khatep's honour and station!

Their numbers are higher than Ungrim had anticipated. It would seem that the two forces that crossed Sylvania's border have combined into one great army of the dead. Facing the entrance to a great cave, a pale figure in a black cloak stands with arms upraised, a pale nimbus of liche-light surrounding him. Eerie words of summoning drift upon the chill wind. Though the Vampire Lord seems absorbed with his rite, the dead who serve him are not. They adopt a defensive stance around their Lord. Pale skeletal warriors await the Dwarfs in a silence broken only by mindless moans of numberless Zombies and the feral cackling of Ghouls and other nameless horrors.	true

Though its exact nature is unclear to most, the barrow’s innate power has drawn others to it, and the agent reports that a local tribe of Forest Goblins uses its summit for their rituals.

missions_localised_description_wh_pro01_dwf_grombrindal_rune_cloak_of_valaya_stage_2	Grombrindal described the rune he had seen in his dreams to the Runesmith. The wise old Dwarf had many centuries under his belt, but was shocked by the complexity and potential power of such a marking. Although this rune was of Valaya's making - the Runesmith could see her hand all over it - it nevertheless uses elements of her brother Gods. To craft such a rune, additional knowledge would be needed; firstly from the Runesmiths in the Dwarfhold of Karak Kadrin where Grimnir's influence is strongest...  	true
missions_localised_description_wh_pro01_dwf_grombrindal_rune_cloak_of_valaya_stage_1	Does the White Dwarf commune with the Ancestor Gods? This is a question oft-asked by Longbeards at the fireside as they drink long into the night. Some say "of course", whereas others believe he is an Ancestor God himself and a few think he has no more influence in this area than any other pious Dawi.\n\nWhatever the case, there have been persistent tales throughout the ages that Valaya looks upon Grombrindal with fondness, and even some sagas proclaiming that they were lovers at the dawn of history. After all, it is Her cloak which shrouds the legendary Dwarf warrior.\n\nAnd so it was that Grombrindal received a vision from the Goddess, a new rune to be sewn into his cloak with thread spun from the hair of Dwarf maidens from the Temple of Valaya in Everpeak. The rune will light the darkest reaches of the Karaz Ankor and reveal a hidden evil to the White Dwarf...	true
missions_localised_description_wh_pro01_dwf_grombrindal_rune_cloak_of_valaya_stage_4	On his way back from Karak Azul, while traversing the Underway, the Runesmith is ambushed by grobi scum! The Goblins attack but are quickly sent on their way by the enraged Dwarf and his bodyguard. It is only in the aftermath that the Runesmith realises the attack was a diversion - the thieves had stolen his copious notes on forming the new rune!\n\nGrombrindal soon discovers that this is not mere kruti luck, but a ploy by Skarsnik, Goblin Warlord of Karak Eight Peaks. The devious gobbo has somehow learned of the Runesmith's powerful knowledge and stolen the notes, but to what actual end remains unknown.\n\nThe White Dwarf learns this tale of woe from another of Valaya's visions. The only Gromril-lining is that if this had been a chance encounter, then the Runesmith would likely have been slain there and then!\n\nThe White Dwarf is enraged at this injustice and immediately begins the hunt for the Runesmith's lore, killing all Greenskins that get in his way!	true

So when three of Clan Eshin's finest come at him from behind during an inspection of his new troops, he is ready. Clocking their reflections in the eyes of a dim-witted Clanrat, he whirls to slit the first assassin's throat. Its companions, realising the futility of their mission, screech in fear and skitter southwards into the night. Around the corpse's neck is found a curious amulet of Greenskin origin...\n\nThe remaining assassins are last seen going to ground nearby.

This uncanny good fortune drives his peers and superiors to distraction... he seems impossible to kill!\n\nThis doesn’t stop them trying, however, and a sudden directive from the Council of Thirteen to raise a force for an imminent yet unexplained mission has Tretch's whiskers twitching.

The assassin was generous with his information; it seems the hit was orchestrated by a high-ranking official of a rival clan. Furthermore, the same clan has employed a mercenary army of Greenskins to move in and decimate Clan Rictus upon Tretch's death!\n\nProtocol prevents direct retaliation against the rival Skaven Lord, but Warlord Tretch demands a target for his fury. Before he was blinded, the assassin gave a rough location for where the Greenskins are mustering their forces. An example must be made for those who dare to cross Clan Rictus!	true

The Staff of Nagash is found - in the hands of Settra the Imperishable himself, and what’s more, the agent has the location of Settra's forces! Arkhan audibly rattles with outrage at the news of Settra's involvement, and begins his march to the location. As they approach their destination, Arkhan senses something is amiss. His own Black Tower seems to be the destination.\n\nArkhan's concern soon grows to mounting horror as he watches rank after rank of Skaven warriors marching into view. He spies ragged banners proclaiming the armies of three - no, four! Four clans are present - A veritable Vermintide! The foremost warlord holds aloft the Staff of Nagash and laughs at the top of its wet lungs. A subterfuge, then... this is Settra's doing! He has gifted the staff to the faithless ratmen in return for Arkhan's destruction - and on his own turf. Betrayed, Arkhan's horror turns to dark rage and steely determination.

A great Orc Warboss has arisen somewhere in the lands south of the Black mountains. His fearsome reputation has gathered many Greenskin tribes behind him in a Waaagh! which is now headed for the main route from the Badlands into the Empire: Black Fire Pass. Whilst messengers are dispatched to alert the Dwarfs, the Emperor tasks one of his most trusted champions to locate the Orc Waaagh!	true

missions_localised_description_wh_main_vmp_heinrich_kemmler_cloak_of_mists_stage_2a	King Marbad fought alongside Sigmar himself in the great wars that saw the birth of the Empire. He fell in battle against a Greenskin horde, sacrificing himself to save the man who would unite the tribes of men into the Empire. Such greatness of spirit is a noble thing for most men, but to Kemmler it represents only a potential source of power waiting to be tapped. Marbad's tomb will doubtless contain vestiges of his spirit, and Kemmler intends to bend this to his own purposes. Texts looted from the Empire’s scriptoriums indicate a location somewhere in Middenland, but the exact site remains a secret, almost certainly to deter the activities of fiends such as Kemmler. He despatches an agent to search Middenland for further clues.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_main_def_morathi_heartrender_and_the_darksword_stage_6	The High Elf colony of Arnheim has no right to be on the Black Coast, and yet it has proved a stubborn canker to remove. However, Morathi, banished to the southern part of Naggarond by her son, and weaving a trail of destruction ever since, now has it in sight. If she can destroy Arnheim, she hopes to return to the Witch King’s good graces and once again take up Heartrender and the Darksword, gifts from her beloved, if temperamental son.	true

But alas her achievements are of little consequence, and her son’s gaze remains fixed on the failing Vortex…\n\nAt least, that is what she wants her enemies to believe, for Morathi is intelligent and cunning. Let Hellebron and Felicion believe that she unleashes a trail of destruction as nothing more than a temper tantrum; the Hag Sorceress has a far worthier target in her sights. But first she will need captives and plenty of them, for preparations must be made before she can bring her dark arts to bear.	true

It is a claim few have made directly to her face, but one she would not deny - and would actually revel in - before flaying the skin off the accuser, of course.\n\nThe instruments of such torture would be her paired weapons; the spear, Heartrender and sister blade, the Darksword.

Even a great triumph over the ancient enemy such as this, however, cannot sate the rasping thirst of the Serpent-God for the blood and lifeforce of His mortal enemy. Tehenhauin, therefore, commits wholeheartedly to the Prophecy foretold upon the Plaque of Sotek, happily rounding up those Skaven not slain in battle and preparing them for ritualistic sacrifice in the Serpent-God’s name.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_great_vortex_lzd_tehenhauin_plaque_of_sotek_stage_3	The Prophet of Sotek’s following has indeed grown many-fold, for the righteous Lizardmen of Chaqua rallied to his call and to the hallowed word of Sotek himself. At last, the time had come to begin the great migration from Chaqua and take the fight directly to the Skaven’s foul nest-lairs and filthy warrens, for the Serpent-God’s appetite for the right kind of slaughter must be fulfilled before He can return, bringing salvation to the Lizardmen of Lustria.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_great_vortex_lzd_tehenhauin_plaque_of_sotek_stage_2	As is the case for many a great prophet through the centuries, Tehenhauin’s following began as a small but dedicated band, but quickly grew as more and more of the Red Crested Skinks of Chaqua rallied to the hallowed words of the Serpent-God. Now, it appears that the Prophecy is coming true, for there are plagues of heinous ratmen fanning out above and beneath the jungle floor, indicating that the time of the Serpent-God is finally at hand. Upon hearing his pronouncement, hundreds of Skinks rally to the Prophet of Sotek’s noble call to arms.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_great_vortex_lzd_tehenhauin_plaque_of_sotek_stage_1	The Plaque of Sotek tells of the Prophecy of the Great Serpent-God, whose blessing wards His chosen servants from harm. Only those who have gained Sotek’s favour are granted a blessing such as this, and attaining that favour involves a rite of passage, even for the bearer of the sacred totem of the Serpent-God, the fabled one true Prophet of Sotek, Tehenhauin. Only by following the Prophecy to the letter, exactly as it appears upon this ancient plaque, can its bearer truly understand and harness its awesome power. Tehenhauin, therefore, knows that it was foretold many aeons hence that his pilgrimage would begin in Chaqua, the legendary City of Gold, currently laid low by the vile Skaven of Clan Pestilens…	true

Now that she has the funds to do so, Cylostra must enhance the ship and make it worthy of operatic royalty.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_great_vortex_cst_cylostra_the_bordeleaux_flabellum_stage_1	With her cursed ship and damned crew, Madame-Captain Cylostra Direfin perpetually sails the seas, relentlessly searching for an audience to witness her beautiful, deadly songs. Her cursed vocal chords, which enable her to paralyse her victims, become more potent during ocean tempests, yet any ship she encounters at any point on her travels might be a target, dooming seafarers to song-induced paralysis before they are dragged to watery graves by her Undead deckhands.\n\nIn order to be constantly ready for the show, however, Cylostra demands the most prestigious platform from which to sing. The Lamprey – an old and rickety vessel – is her floating stage and requires improvements of the standard she demands. To that end, Cylostra must first fill the ship's coffers with booty.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc07_qb_brt_louen_sword_of_couronne_stage_0	A mist rolls down from the mountains covering the lands of Bretonnia. The origin of this dense effluvium is as murky as the mist itself; all the people of Bretonnia know is that what was not there before is there now, obfuscating and obscuring all. Yet more troubling than the mist itself is what lies beyond - the shouting and smashing of the Greenskin hordes haunt the dreams of the peasants, who fear they may be next. The people panic, refusing to leave their homes, lest they be next victims of the slavering, rampaging Orcish host.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc07_qb_brt_louen_sword_of_couronne_stage_1	The fog has affected all. It has become so thick that the light of the sun cannot pierce it. So it is across the Bretonnian marches; a land of quarrelsome yet bright climate now despairs under the infernal fog, forsaken by the sun. As the light fades from the land, so too does the Sword of Couronne's aura ebb and dim. King Leoncoeur grows concerned and so, sealing the ancestral blade away, endeavours to discover the source and solution to the impenetrable mist.\n\nAll across Bretonnia, dukedoms report that the mist is giving rise to mania; a Greenskin horde rampages there, taking advantage of the murk to smash, pillage and spread destruction across the land. Although it may not be a permanent solution, the king has an immediate duty to protect his people.	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc07_qb_brt_louen_sword_of_couronne_stage_3	Artois is deeply affected by the descent of the all-consuming mist, but the people still, somehow, endure, in a display of bold Bretonnian resilience. When pressed for information, the peasants mention something about a nameless, shrouded wanderer spreading rumours of an 'evil fog' approaching just before the self-same miasma descended upon them. At last report, the wanderer was headed in the direction of the Forest of Arden.\n\nLeoncoeur knows that even the hardiest Knight of Bretonnia would be in great peril so close to Athel Loren. This wanderer knows something of the ever-present mist, yet is still in great danger. More to the point, his demise would sever the only lead the king has in this mystery. With great haste, he dispatches an agent to intercept the mysterious man.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cylostra_the_bordeleaux_flabellum_mp	A self-obsessed singer needs a doting audience, and Cylostra is technically still well overdue for a high-profile performance before the High Elves of Ulthuan. Many years ago, when the Lamprey succumbed to a storm in the Eastern Straits of the Great Ocean, before Cylostra’s transformation, she was on an important diplomatic voyage to sing before the Phoenix King. A treaty of great import was reliant on his pleasure in her performance, for the Elves believe good art – music in particular – to be as valuable as gems and gold. It was an important engagement, so surely the High Elves will still be waiting for her? Cylostra decided to head towards the southern end of the Shifting Isles, where the High Elves' Old World shipping lanes are located, following them directly into the great Elven port of Lothern and, hopefully, to the Phoenix King himself... \n\nCylostra orders the Lamprey through the Shifting Isles – the ones that are currently visible, at least – ordering her lookouts to keep their rotting eyeballs peeled. At first it seems there's no High Elf naval presence anywhere to be seen - whether the Asur are under the magical protection of the ancient spells shrouding the area, or are simply eluding her by other means, Cylostra does not know. Suddenly, she spots a ship moored off one of the islands, where large numbers of troops are disembarking. And what's this? Could it be the standard of the Phoenix King she sees? From the look of the ship, it certainly belongs to the High Elf fleet at the very least. There's not time to waste - only time to get ready for the show!	true

But Volkmar the Grim is not known for giving up. He sends his best Templars of the Holy Order after the Undead thieves. Witch Hunters are famously dogged in pursuing their prey and this agent is no different. Word soon reaches Volkmar that the Witch Hunter has picked up the trail and has divined that the Necromancer is heading for Hel Fenn...	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc04_emp_volkmar_the_grim_jade_griffon_stage_3	The Witch Hunters of the Holy Order of Sigmar have a certain talent for extracting information, even from those of an Undead persuasion. When torture isn't an option there are certain hexes and rituals that may well work. In any case, crucial information has been learned regarding the Necromancer's plans, and they are diabolical indeed. Should Helman and the Brothers Ghorst get hold of the Jade Griffon, then he will use a dark spell from his Cursed Book, one that will taint the talisman and flood it with fell magic. On learning this, Volkmar angrily rises from his chair and spits orders. The Jade Griffon must be found before Ghorst gets his hands on it. And if that means every Kislevite dwelling upturned in the search, then so be it!     	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc04_emp_volkmar_the_grim_jade_griffon_stage_2	According to the Witch Hunters, Mannfred von Carstein's willing creature, Helman Ghorst, has also started searching for the Jade Griffon. To have a talisman blessed by Magnus fall into the hands of a Necromancer such as he would be a fell thing indeed. Volkmar tasks his agents with breaching Ghorst's lair, thus distracting the liche and halting the Undead servant's search before it can truly begin.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc04_emp_volkmar_the_grim_jade_griffon_stage_1	Sigmar has ever-been a warrior god, and his clergy have followed his example. They are no mere priests or tranquil monks but warriors all - as eager to split skulls with hammer as preach from a pulpit. At the head of the Cult is the Grand Theogonist, and while many have filled the role over the years, most - if not all - have been intimidating men; full of fury and bombast, and piously devoted to Sigmar's tenets.\n\nShould the Empire come under threat, then it is not always state troops that must face the threat alone. The Cult of Sigmar has often answered the call to war, with the Grand Theogonist at its head, eager as any of his Warrior Priests to smite the foe. It was on one such doomed campaign that the Jade Griffon - a talisman of the Theogonist's office, said to have been blessed by Magnus the Pious himself - went missing. The Grand Theogonist at the time was brought low by Chaos filth, and the Jade Griffon lost somewhere in Kislev.\n\nMany years later, and word has reached Volkmar the Grim that the Jade Griffon has resurfaced. The Grand Theogonist senses that the time is right to go in search of this precious antiquity. Volkmar issues a proclamation that he intends to march for Kislev. In the vanguard of his force go the desperate and the fanatical - those that have lost everything but their faith. Let their zeal light the way.	true

To the Hierophant's shock, the shelves around his bones are stacked with Mortuary Cult tomes! Have the Dark Elves truly been dabbling in the arts of resurrection? This demands further enquiry - Khatep must know more. An ancient map on the crumbling desk marks the location of a city - and a sister library...	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_mortal_empires_tmb_khatep_the_liche_staff_3	Khatep enters the great library and scours it for further clues. Among the array of magical texts, bestiaries, and codices, one tome stands out for its more recent binding. Khatep is staggered to find within its pages a new liturgy, capable of binding a soul to a living host. There is some risk to both participants, of course, but could this be the answer? A way to renew Settra - and others besides - to true life? Surely this would restore Khatep's honour and station! Divining an appropriate site for the liturgy will require a powerful expenditure of energy - a Nehekharan Rite should suffice.	true

Gripped by conviction as to his fate, he searches in vain for a challenge worthy of him. At last, after weeks or perhaps months of aimless wandering, Archaon determines to seek answers from one of the Chaos Sorcerers who have attached themselves to his horde. Such mortals barter fractions of their souls in exchange for greater magical powers. They are seen as the oracles of the Gods and act as prophets, seers and counsellors, guiding their warlords and chieftains to ever greater conquests.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_great_vortex_tmb_khalida_venom_staff_stage_1	The blessing of Asaph, the Asp-Goddess, has waned of late. The divine venom in Khalida’s veins flows sluggishly, and her Venom Staff seems devoid of the goddess' fury. Deeply concerned by this, she summons her priestesses for counsel. After much deliberation, they propose a ritual to invoke the Asp-Goddess and awaken her blessing once more. The incantations cannot be performed without due honours, however. To provide a fitting stage for the ceremony, the Temple of Asaph must be restored to its former glory.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_great_vortex_tmb_khalida_venom_staff_stage_2	Khalida arranges herself in the restored temple, and the priestesses begin their invocations. As the chant rises, Khalida begins to feel the venom quickening within her. Opening her mind in supplication to the goddess, she hears  Asaph's familiar voice whisper to her "Khalida, my chosen. You feel my blessing once more. But it is weakened, for there is foul work afoot. The cursed Lahmians meddle once more... they sully my sacred ground. Locate my shrine at the Springs of Eternal Life. Purge it of Lahmian filth. With this ritual, you have given me a tribute of magic. Next you must restore beauty...". As the voice of the goddess fades, Khalida sends for her agents. Asaph's shrine must be found.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_great_vortex_tmb_khalida_venom_staff_stage_3	When Khalida enters Asaph's shrine, a scene of desecration greets her. Thousands of snake-bones litter the cave floor and the springwater is befouled by necromancy. The source of the corruption, a black orb, lies upon the altar of Asaph. Enraged, Khalida bellows in fury and shatters the artefact, then curtly orders her priestesses to prepare a rite of purification. As their intonations fill the caverns, the corrupted waters turn pure again, and serpents emerge from crevices to form a writhing carpet. Khalida hears the voice of Asaph, stronger now "The beauty of my shrines is restored, but vengeance is yet unanswered. You will find our enemies on the river turned to ash. Destroy them in my name!" Emerging from the cavern, Khalida orders her forces to march tirelessly for Ash River. The spawn of Neferata will be undone!	true

As a symbol of intent, he demands a statue be raised in his image, one worthy of the greatest ruler that has ever walked the earth. It must be an effigy of pure magnificence. Settra issues his orders. Only the finest materials may be used in its construction - Ka-Sabar marble, Tilean gold, and black opals from the Sylvanias. Anything less will arouse his severest displeasure.	true
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_settra_the_blessed_blade_of_ptra_stage_2	The materials having been secured, a design for the statue is presented.

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_grn_wurrzag_da_great_green_prophet_squiggly_beast_stage_2	Wurrzag’s beloved Squiggly Beast remains lost. Those he sent cower before him as he rants about their abject failure and how they displease Gork and Mork. One, while remaining cowed by the Prophet’s anger, does raise the possibility of a lead. During his search he noticed that many Squig herds have also gone missing. Wurrzag dismisses them all with a strong cuff to the head with his staff. However, he does agree that missing Squig herds cannot be a coincidence. He decides to hire some "professionalz" to get to the bottom of this mystery, and who better than those Squig Hoppers who have just lost their Squigs?	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_grn_wurrzag_da_great_green_prophet_squiggly_beast_stage_3	Those Night Goblins who were recently robbed of their Squigs wander the land on the trail of their missing mounts. They are gone for a while, but on their return bring news that an especially cunning gobbo had tried to rustle a large herd of Cave Squigs from the Tattered Ear Night Goblins. The rustler was fought off and went to ground at one of two possible locations before he could be caught, hog-tied and brought to Wurrzag.\n\nThis is all the information that Wurrzag requires. He demands that his followers raid the settlements and find his Squiggly Beast, or the git who’s dared to steal ‘im!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_grn_wurrzag_da_great_green_prophet_squiggly_beast_stage_1	Wurrzag is fond of his Squiggly Beast, in so much as an Orc can be affectionate towards anything. The beast was once a rival Shaman in the Bone Nose tribe until magical energy arched from Wurrzag’s eyes. The green lightning struck the Shaman and instantly transformed him into the Squiggly Beast that has been his companion ever since. Da Great Green Prophet will often pet it while deep in contemplation, deciphering the visions of the Green Godz, or set the beast on the Snotling herds and watch dispassionately as it happily munches through several swarms.\n\nAnd so when Wurrzag woke from a deep trance to find the Squiggly Beast had gone missing, he was not at all pleased. There was a rage and anger there that even Grimgor could not match. Magical energy flicked across the Savage Orc Shaman’s eyes - the Squiggly Beast had to be found or another member of the tribe would unwittingly become Wurrzag’s new pet!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc03_bst_khazrak_one_eye_scourge_stage_1_grandcampaign	The curses of man are many - they think to purge the forests of the warherds! Todbringer sends out his armies from Middenheim to rid the Drakwald of Gors. They have slain bray-kin, while the chieftains vie for petty power. However, should the Cloven Ones flock to one banner, Middenheim stands high on the Ulricsberg plateau, making a brute force attack futile. No, to make Boris Todbringer pay, a more cunning approach is needed if the Children of Chaos are to raze his city to ash and ruin… \n\nKhazrak knows that the Elector Count of Middenheim is an honourable fool. Once he sees his people burning, Boris will surely come to their rescue, luring him away from the Ulricsberg. Such acts will also cause panic and fear in the Empire’s subjects, and quicken Beastmen hearts.

The allure of the Serpent is highly addictive to most, but you have infuriated it by resisting the lure of its pride, arrogance, and excess.

It is a feeding ground. You turn to ask the Skink if this is the place to bait a trap, but the reptile has gone! All that remains is a shackle containing a foot gnawed through at the ankle. It seems the trap is not yours to set - for you are the bait!\n\nA great roar rumbles across the clearing, the ground shakes, birds scatter from the lush canopies, and the usually-loud jungle is suddenly silent... until pierced by another roar. Then, from the trees, a chanting is heard "Gargantulzan! Gargantulzan! Gargantulzan!"\n\nThe behemoth has arrived, and you must now fight a Carnosaur of legend!	true

For this vainglorious diva, the world is not enough – Cylostra has set her heart on stardom and becoming a household name again.

Her cursed vocal chords, which enable her to paralyse her victims, become more potent during ocean tempests, yet any ship she encounters at any point on her travels might be a target, dooming seafarers to song-induced paralysis before they are dragged to watery graves by her Undead deckhands.\n\nIn order to be constantly ready for the show, however, Cylostra demands the most prestigious platform from which to sing. The Lamprey – an old and rickety vessel – is her floating stage and requires improvements of the standard she demands. To that end, Cylostra must first fill the ship's coffers with booty.	true

While Tyrion impatiently waits within while Vaul's smiths reknit the armour, he is called to the shrine’s entrance. Druchii gather!

Tyrion’s presence is a small comfort, but the Asur have always been highly attuned to the magical eddies that assail the world. And all - from Swordmaster to poet to humble cordwainer - feel the doom encroach as the Vortex fails.\n\nAmidst this unease, the rumours of Dark Elves hidden amongst the populace persists, and that an assassination attempt on the Phoenix King and his foremost champions is imminent. It is fortunate that the world’s best bodyguards reside on Ulthuan - in Chrace to be specific.	true

Or something more contrived? In any event, the armour must be returned to where it was forged for repair.	true

Reports of coastal raids are flooding into Lothern and even that the Witch King is now abroad. Fear spreads that Dark Elves land upon Ulthuan and are trying inveigle themselves into the populace - ready to pounce upon neighbours when bidden by Malekith.\n\nFinubar calls his unofficial war council of which Tyrion is the central pillar.

However, in their haste it would appear that the scouts were somewhat careless, as they have been followed to Kroak’s location by a force of those insidious ratmen, the Skaven!

He has an added advantage, however, in that he is technically dead; Kroak’s mortal body was killed during the Great Catastrophe but his remains were preserved by loyal Skink attendants, enabling him to re-emerge as the first Relic Priest.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_monster_hunt_8_stage_4_mpc	Even by the Norse, it is known that the Annulii Mountains - the unbroken chain that surrounds the Elven home of Ulthuan - are a rich habitat for many wonderous creatures. While the Chaos wastes to the north will always provide the tainted and deranged, the creatures that inhabit the Annulii seem 'purer' and therefore are a more desirable prey.\n\nWord had reached you of a rumour amongst the Dark Elves that a Phoenix matriarch, one that has not been seen in centuries, will appear on Ulthuan once again. Legend has it that it is a creature of Hekarti, existing between the mortal plane and the Realm of Chaos. The 'Mother of the Flame' only makes its appearance on the side of the mortal veil rarely, once a century at most, awoken into this world through the heart of a burning volcano. The source of the rumour was a Dark Elf merchant of the black market, who also had knowledge of where the Phoenix is due to appear. He would not give up the information without some petty bargaining, however, which you had little patience for. As you unleashed your Ice Wolves upon him, the wretch told you all you needed to know before one of them bit through his spinal cord with a wet crack.\n\nVaul’s Anvil, on the southern edge of Ulthuan, is your next destination – a raging volcano and sacred site for the Asur. The Norse gather their longships and set sail. The High Elves will do everything they can to stop the Northmen setting foot on their precious isle, but they shall fail.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_monster_hunt_9_stage_4_mpc	The jungles of Lustria are teeming with deadly - and perpetually hungry - predators, but the legend of Gargantulzan reverberates through the continent, spooking the Amazons and sending the Pygmies darting back into their warrens. The mightiest of feral Carnosaurs has roamed Lustria for centuries, but now will become the prey.\n\nIn an effort to obtain a guide to take you through the fetid jungles on the beast's trail, you sought out the slave-merchants of the Point. The pathetic slavers initially drew a blank on a willing guide, before one of them dared to make a suggestion, leading you to a cage containing a small reptile – a Skink. He claimed that with the right amount of ‘persuasion’, it would lead you to your quarry. At first the Skink claimed ignorance of the dark tongue spoken by your tribe, but when one of your men started to cut off its head-crest it broke into a broken version of Empire-speak known as Reikspiel, babbling non-stop about some 'Great Plan', before finally mentioning a possible lead.\n\nAfter a brief stop at the Norse colony of Skeggi for provisions and a blessing to the Ruinous Powers, your reptilian guide leads you deep into the jungle, seemingly far less reluctant in giving directions. If you didn't know better, you would think the creature was enjoying the misery wrought on your Norsemen - who are people used to cold and ice - now dealing with intense heat and gad-flies constantly feasting on their flesh.\n\nIn the far distance, unmistakable roars are heard of timeless beasts on the hunt. It seems the quarry is getting closer...	true

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_grn_skarsnik_skarsniks_prodder_stage_1	It is said that there is a whole chapter in the Dammaz Kron on Skarsnik, the self-proclaimed Warlord of the Eight Peaks. Both the Dwarfs and the Skaven despise him, and yet none doubt his supremacy over the region. The fact he has achieved such an iron grip, although merely a Night Goblin and not some brutal Orc, says more about his malign intelligence than any chapter in some stunties' silly book!\n\nDwarfs are stubborn, but even that fat fool at Everpeak at least acknowledges that the Eight Peaks are lost. Yet the Angrund Clan refuse to accept the status quo - they deny the truth, that their ancestral home is beyond their meagre, stunted grasp. Even now they are set on another foolish attempt to wrest control from Skarsnik! However, nothing escapes the eyes and ears of the Warlord. News of a fresh expedition quickly reaches him and in his unusually astute Greenskin brain another wicked plan is formulated. To begin, Skarsnik will send this new throng his personal ‘greetings’...	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_grn_skarsnik_skarsniks_prodder_stage_2	While the stunties are distracted by the loss of their pathetic Lord, Skarsnik's forces storm through the Peaks, raiding and destroying anything in sight. This is Skarsnik’s way, a method tempered through years of dealing with the power-hungry Orcs that have tried to take his throne: perceive the threat and then utterly destroy the foe before it can act against you!	true
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc06_grn_skarsnik_skarsniks_prodder_stage_4	Well that was exhausting! It was a sight to warm Skarsnik's rotten heart - to see the Dwarfs scatter with their beards between their little legs! However, the Goblin boss can't help brood - how can he impose his will if an Orc has a better reach? Maybe he needs a long stick like those wizards always carry around with them? While he ponders on the problem, his best 'recruiterz' are sent to bolster the horde, as a few were killed during the fight. The Warlord demands they be replaced by 'somefing arder dan Orcs'.	true

A pretext created to lure Hellebron into a direct assault, allowing the Hag Sorceress to claim she was provoked and thereby destroy the Blood Queen once and for all, without fear of reprisal from any on the Black Council.\n\nIt is a challenge that Hellebron must answer or look fatally weak.

She puts her wrath on a simmer, and will deal with him when he inevitably returns to her service, for there is no-one else that offers him the challenging targets she does.\n\nIn the meantime, Hellebron's concerns lie with her chosen paired weapons – the blades have dulled having separated so many necks. It is Morathi's fault! It always is! The whore of Ghrond has for too long kept the secrets of agelessness – for flesh and metal – from the Blood Queen.\n\nTo wrest such lore from Malekith's mother is no easy task. After all, it's one that Hellebron has been trying to steal for thousands of years. A more subtle approach is needed. However, Morathi is unpredictable.

missions_localised_description_wh_main_grn_azhag_the_slaughterer_crown_of_sorcery_stage_1	Once Azhag was the chieftain of a little-known tribe subsisting high in Troll Country. The Greenskin tribes in the far north are bitter rivals, fighting choppa-and-claw over the few spoils the hostile, barren lands provide. Since then, Azhag has come south to the Badlands, but now events seem to be drawing him back to his old stamping ground once more. Azhag has received a tip from an unlikely source: a captured gobbo from a rival tribe, desperate not to be eaten. The snivelling little git claims he knows of an abandoned tomb-city, once the seat of a great king who worshipped dark powers. Within this necropolis are said to be great treasures... Azhag cuffs one of his own Goblin Bosses around the ear and hoofs him out of the camp, telling him not to come back until he's found this mythical place.	true
missions_localised_description_wh_main_grn_azhag_the_slaughterer_crown_of_sorcery_stage_2	Despite low expectations, the Goblin scout has found a possible location for this lost city that Azhag's increasingly-loony Shaman insists on calling Todtheim. The Shaman rants on about some humie Necromancer who has some connection with the place and whose iron crown is rumoured to be there. The crown is said to allow its wearer to wield sorcerous powers. He also mutters something about the crown's ability to possess its wearer, but Azhag isn't paying attention anymore. The scout has found an "'orrible" place that stinks of the Ruinous Powers. However, to loot it will be no easy feat as circling above the ruins are flying creatures, flocks of fell bats and other, more monstrous things. To be able to fully explore the dead city, Azhag's mob will need to control the skies as well as the land.	true

Every hero, champion, and monster who has heard the utterance of his undeniable challenge has fallen defeated before him with their skulls taken as his trophies. And still, Wulfrik’s burning desire to engage in murderous single combat always remains unsated.\n\nRecently, the Gods sent Wulfrik a vision in which he glimpsed a great and lauded Bretonnian hero atop a mighty charger. The horseman of Wulfrik’s dream was drenched in blood, a sign that he was the next quarry. Leading his army southward, Wulfrik viciously raided the lands of Bretonnia's capital in an effort to draw the hero out, but he did not appear. He then learnt of a small keep in Lyonesse which contains holy relics, precious treasures, and stately heirlooms, all of which are of great importance to the Bretonnian Kingdom.\n\nSeeing the opportunity, Wulfrik calls on his warband to immediately march south towards the venerated keep to attack it. The hero is yet to show himself, but Wulfrik will get his duel one way or another!	true
