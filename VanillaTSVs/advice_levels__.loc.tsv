advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669212	Though the Dwarfs and Greenskins lie between us and the realms of man, Malagor, they are trifling obstacles. You are the Dark Omen - Dhar Armeu - destined to bring an unending age of destruction to man's Uncloven world!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669610	Be sure to arrange your infantry in a line for the coming battle, my lord. Each unit should cover the flank of the next. Do not let the enemy attack the sides of your formation, or break through to the rear!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669710	Morghur's forces will not relent until you are defeated. Push them back, Orion, and strengthen the Oak of Ages, for only the Oak's power can hope to break Morghur's hold on immortality. Hurry; there is not much time!	true

But Bretonnian Knights are formidable warriors and driven by the most noble of purposes! The kingdom is relying on you, my lord, you must drive the filth back into the mire!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670166	A storm is brewing above Bretonnia, my lord, with a ferocity that Bordeleaux cannot avoid. You may not be king, Alberic, but Manann watches over you. Use his thalassic strength to defend Bordeleaux and wash your enemies away!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_1250419572	Across the straits, Elves and the accursed lizards rule the jungle cities. As you well know, much gold can be plundered here and resources gathered to further your fleet - just avoid the cursed treasure… 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1307559367	Be wary, though, for while the Vortex is weakened the forces of Chaos will slip into this world. Ready your defences, for they will doubtless be drawn to the ritual’s power.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1926516469	The cold-blooded beasts of the Lustrian jungles draw near. Be wary of the Lizardmen, my lord, their motives are often hard to fathom, but the ferocity of their warriors and the sharpness of their claws are in little doubt.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2127886688	The altar is but a verminous nest! The Skaven corrupt this place of power – rid them from these ruins and secure the scrolls for your own cause.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669166	The despicable armies of darkness have assaulted this place, slaughtering all they can find and razing the town to dust. They have left an artefact to spread the foul taint of Chaos across the land. Destroy it!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_1534109927	I come for you, creatures of the night. It is foolish to think the jungles can conceal your presence from me.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139667365	Excellent! The enemy scries your movements. The Necromancer will no doubt be planning counter-manoeuvres of his own.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139667665	To the south, yet more vicious urki and grobi lay ready to strike at your kin. Seek allies amongst your own folk, for there are many grudges to settle here.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668765	You may use the hills, valleys... and stranger formations of this place to your advantage, Commander. The terrain can conceal your forces.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669565	The forest is with you, Durthu. The ever-increasing threat of the Beastmen must be defeated immediately!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1034630750	And beyond that is a greater prize, one the reptiles claim as the first city. It shall be mine.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668564	Your soldiers are ready to deploy for battle, my lord. They await your orders.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668864	The enemy general joins the battle at last! Gnashrak fights amidst his mounted warriors. Cut him down!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_1176554168	The Brood Queens you seek are here, my lord, but do not underestimate this enemy! Seldom do hunters have to bring down so many giant spiders in a single hunt. 	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139667369	Your forces are depleted by battle, Sire, yet such a shortfall is easily solved by your kind. Raise the slain to fight at your banner! March upon the enemy using their own warriors!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669069	East of Bretonnia lies the Empire, the very pinnacle of mankind's hubris. Its capital, Altdorf, is the centre of power and a symbol of its surety. Reduce it all to rubble - let pandemonium reign. The Empire is powerful, but divided. You must strike soon, for it may yet unify and seek to bring "civilisation" to the blood-grounds.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669469	The time has come to advance, my lord. First, select your own unit, in order to rejoin your forces.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669368	The nearby area is teeming with tribes of inferior Greenskins; to the east, the Teef Snatchaz and Red Fangs gather, eager to exploit you and regain lost lands. Yet you are chosen by the gods - they will see that you prevail.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_1796199227	Ghrond has fallen, my lord - the depraved followers of the Hag Sorceress now bend their knee to you. Nevertheless, be wary of a counter-attack. Be sure to erect a shrine as soon as can be, in order to gain the scrolls you seek.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1958778147	The shifting sands to the east are full of death. Those that dwell here are neither friend nor foe, but they carry a plague of Undeath which must be prepared for.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1043695353	Hail, dread scourge Malekith! You rule over a splintered people, your realm is in decay, and there are many vile creatures who will attempt to stop your advance.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1831323300	But an immediate threat resides within these craggy mountains. The Red Eye Tribe, a vicious horde of Greenskins, sack and pillage the halls of your mighty kin. And they now dare turn their beady eyes on you, my king!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_1436360616	The Crow caws with distaste for your disobedience, and with it the gifts you once had have been stripped from you!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1570058224	My crew are loyal, even the dead ones given to me by Father. Yet these Vampires have their own agendas. I had better test their loyalty or throw them into the salt. 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668173	Consider varying your tactics when manoeuvring in the face of the enemy, my lord. Placing an ambush, or setting a defensive camp, may bring about victory where a straight engagement would fail.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668473	Natural resources are abundant in this place, my lord. Capture it, and its riches would be yours.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668973	Your territory expands, savage lord, yet there are many lands to conquer. In time, I foresee war with the greater tribes of the Badlands, as well as the stunted kind that dwell beneath the mountains. Keep your axe sharp, for Mork and Gork watch your progress with interest!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669673	Morghur! The vile, twisted Beastlord of corruption and mutation emerges from the shadows to rain his destruction upon our realm. 	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670072	Bretonnia stands strong as the protector of honour and chivalry. Yet one last challenge must still be met, in the wastes of the Old World. Our king prepares for battle on the grandest of scales and calls forth an Errantry War. I ask  you now to bestow your great virtues upon us and lead the Knightly Orders to their final victory over our enemy!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1442219700	My lord, the enemy field artillery against you! They will be able to strike against your forces at great range!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1573311311	Khaine! I stand before you seeking the pleasures of war. Blood will flow and I shall bathe this ravaged body anew.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669172	Your warriors have raised an artefact of worship to the Dark Gods in the rubble of this wretched place. It spreads the taint of Chaos across the land, mighty lord, weakening the resolve of those that might stand against you.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_1340208705	Council desires I collect Warpstone, yes-yes! Perfect opportunity to look-seem like loyal servant of Council. I take all Warpstone and tell the fools I do it for them. Smart-cunning Chief Warlock Engineer I am!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1431704452	Do not take these behemoths lightly, my lord, for they are no ordinary Cygors. They hurl clusters of boulders with frightening speed, and will do so with reckless abandon. 	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2006847992	Push back this green tide, my lord, for you are the last Slayer King of Karak Kadrin!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139667571	Your enemies are belligerent and won’t necessarily cow down to your indomitable will - they need to be tamed, broken or annihilated!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668071	Knowledge of your own strengths is vital if any conquest is to succeed. Your kind are wild and barbarous, my lord. Success will never be won around the table, but on the battlefield.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668371	My lord, the enemy raid your lands and slaughter your denizens! Take up arms against them, make them pay dearly for their transgressions!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139667170	The Crooked Moon tribe have agreed to stay out of your fight against the Red Fang. Time will tell if they are good to their word, and if not they will feel the wrath of Grimgor! 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139667270	The Greenskins of the Bloody Spearz continue to defile your most sacred monuments. They must be expelled from these mountains with all haste! No Dwarf king should tolerate such a presence so close to Everpeak! 	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669470	It is time to establish your first Asrai Lookout beyond Athel Loren's woodland boughs. Establishing such outposts is vitally important, if you wish to conquer the Old World, with a precious piece of Amber your reward for each one constructed.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668477	A strategic overview can be useful in such uncertain times, Sire.   	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668977	Your burgeoning realm grows, your eminence, yet many evils still abound in this world.

You must remain vigilant.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669177	Spells may be overcast to increase their potency, my lord. Yet I advise caution: channelling so much raw magic at once brings the risk of disaster.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669376	Demonstrate your strength to these weaklings, and tribes of lesser Orcs will flock to your banner, freeing you to pursue your twisted prophecies. The stunted Dwarfs that dwell in the mountains around you should provide plentiful quarry.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_1065475264	The hated Asur of Ulthuan have also struck against you, landing forces on the shores of Naggaroth. Throw them back and, should you feel malicious, invade the kingdoms of Ulthuan to exact your vengeance!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1386349514	They are Soul-Eaters, so it may be difficult to wield magic against them. Difficult, but not impossible. Like all Cygors, the brothers see the Winds of Magic through their single eyes, which causes them to be in a constant state of fury.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1558506276	Priests of Asaph rejoice, for a third book of Nagash enters my possession! Those that stand before the Queen of Lybaras shall fall!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668074	The boyz' clamour for battle grows with each victory. The fervour of your kind can be a powerful force if harnessed, but an Orc's lust for blood - if left unsated - can be his undoing.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668874	Gnashrak flees the valley! The grobi that remain will surely lose the will to fight.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669574	Move quickly to defend this ridge, my lord. The trees will grant your warriors cover, while the slope will provide them an advantage in combat.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668979	The taint of Undeath is spread by your conquests, mighty lord. Your realm grows, and more distant lands now fall under your gaze. The Empire and other kingdoms of men lie to the north and west: there you may feast, for the living are plentiful.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669079	To the south, the border princes hold a tentative grip on all that they call theirs, yet they are isolated by the mountains and the Blackfire Pass - soft targets for a hungry herd such as ours.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668078	I know your patience wears thin, my king, but you must temper the need for vengeance with further intelligence of the grobi's actions. There is nothing more to do for now.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139668178	You need not grow weary of battle, my lord. You do not need to oversee every skirmish in person - there are many gods of war on this world and they will take an interest whether you do so or not...	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669478	Like the Worldroots before it, an Asrai Lookout has succumbed to the enemy, my lord. Alas, a piece of Amber has been lost along with it.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669778	Yet there are others who would oppose you. The Wood Elves, hidden behind their sanctuary trees, have long stood in opposition to your goals. Twist their gnarled roots into unknowable agony; let them know defeat!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669878	You have the strength to stop Morghur.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_1816650345	But take heed – the Treemen of the forest will not sit back while we attack! They will try and save their monstrous Champion, just as it saved them in the past.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_797975384	Here we may see the state of the province that surrounds your capital. The enemy raids have caused considerable unrest; obedience is suffering as you can see, my lord. The agitators will need suppressing in time, but matters of defence are more urgent.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_833995385	The Under-City has been established! You can now extend the Under-Empire into this region by building warrens directly underneath the unsuspecting settlement.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_683600275	The screams of the vanquished echo across Naggaroth, for the lives of those conquered in battle are forfeit to servitude.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_405604948	The threat of the Skaven has been dealt with for now. If you construct buildings that increase our ability to detect the ratmen’s presence below, it will be more difficult for them to attempt their underhanded occupation tactics again.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_634092929	Your kind are not well-suited to this country, my lord. Do not rush to establish a permanent presence here: it may be wiser to pillage all that you can and fall back to more hospitable lands.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_213352615	Blessings to you, Lord of the Solar-City! Your domain is prosperous and powerful, yet the same cannot be said for all realms of the younger generations. Many temples have fallen to ruin or to invaders from afar.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_841702547	Many plaques remain hidden, harboured by the pox-ridden vermin! The rat-spawn are only fit for one purpose – for sacrifice to Sotek! He compels us to chase them from their burrows and onto the sacrificial altars. May the Great Serpent rise again!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_934441871	The great and terrible power of the Shrine of Khaine has for too long been free for those of callous heart to wield, Everqueen. In Asur hands, however, the shrine's potency may be turned to more noble causes.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_881767946	Mighty Prophet, we have gained access to new sacrifices. Their rewards may be greater, but Sotek demands offerings of greater numbers in return. Thousands more will have to be sacrificed in the Serpent-God’s name.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_196318106	Lord Kroak will be an invaluable ally in the fulfilment of the Great Plan, but his worldly relics are in imminent danger.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_458452474	I see them. Morsels writhing around in the dirt, trying to steal what is mine, taking relics in an attempt to save their precious Vortex. How amusing… Send my thralls to stop them, let them taste Asur blood - this is but the start of what is to come!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_484654354	O mighty Kroq-Gar, you find yourself far from home on an expedition to the Southlands. Yet you are not alone, here. Other Lizard-kin may be found nearby, although their interpretation of the Great Plan may differ from yours. I advise caution.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_779267114	The Sorceress is ready to unleash her first ritual against the Vortex of the Asur; but Felicion is not alone in trying to influence the magic maelstrom.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_684247164	Deception and trickery have served in seizing a foothold here in Naggaroth. The Dark Elves' seat of power lies tantalisingly close. Just across the Sea of Malice, where in Naggarond another king, a feeble one, tallest of the Hydra's heads, needs silencing.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_762113450	Violent murderess, Queen Hellebron, the sounds of torment and death ring out throughout your city of Har Ganeth.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_768519411	Your kind thrive on the machinations of statecraft, noble lord. Influence won amongst your peers in the halls of the Asur is a currency like no other, and can be spent on favours both home and abroad.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_377017246	The Lizardmen move in number, re-entering ruined cities in their search for magical artefacts. They must seek some machination regarding the Vortex.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_882034754	The Season of Murder has come early it seems! Druchii attack and dominate my realm in order to seize the Scrolls of Hekarti, the very lore I seek. My wrath will be swift, their blood will be collected for my personal unguents.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_846160442	But these, Great King, are but more distractions to a grander plan. The Black Pyramid stands guarded for now by a Sentinel army; control it and claim its dark secrets and with it unimaginable power.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_856566703	A word in your ear: despite the great power you command, the loyalty of your followers cannot always be presumed.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_454617435	Elf-things come from sea fortress. In time we take that-that too. Good base for Queek, maybe-yes!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_470497323	The sea offers wealth and power, but Lustria is home to the abandoned cities of the Lizardmen and their many mysterious treasures. Using their artefacts, we will surely be able to uncover some way to repair my damaged psyche! We must!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_107039269	You have cut the Shaggoth off, my lord, but you should tread with care - Traygard is more ancient and powerful than most others of his kind. 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_692747019	The oceans of this world are a ferocious and deadly place, but nothing compares with the Galleon's Graveyard; sail carefully here, my lord, for it has devoured many great ships that have strayed too close.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_883702818	Across the straits are the desert lands of the Liche King. He has always been an ally to Vampires, but his fate depends on whether he wants to make an enemy of me. There is only room for one king in these parts!	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_185635603	I yearn to journey back to Khemri, past the bestial hordes that war with us and across the cold mountains harbouring a dark, chaotic magic - as unsubtle as it is destructive.	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_598378144	The Druchii - Dark Elves, to the ignorant races - are an insidious threat, Prince Tyrion. Left unchecked, their cunning and malevolence will infiltrate High Elf society to its very core. Take steps to ensure this does not come to pass!	true

advice_levels_onscreen_text_81347084	But it is the sea, not the sand that calls – the Seafather would have you sit upon a throne of coral and rule the world and so sends Undead allies to aid your cause. You are the Queen of the Tides – all shall bow to your piratical majesty!	true
