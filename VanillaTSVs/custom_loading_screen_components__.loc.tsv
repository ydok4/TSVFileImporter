custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh_main_chs_chaos_kholekcustom_quote	The storms gather, raging across the north, rousing the oldest of Shaggoths. Kholek has awoken and his anger is as fierce as he is ancient. Now is the time to honour the ancient pact made with the Chaos Gods – to wage endless war. For Kholek Suneater is no mere minion of the Ruinous Powers, but the Herald of the Tempest.	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_dlc10_def_hellebron_gccustom_quote	The Death Night is upon us, but will no longer be contained within the walls of Har Ganeth. The whole world is full of mewling victims awaiting the attention of the Blood Queen. Hellebron will go forth and demand submission. She will bathe in the blood of Elf, Lizardmen, Skaven, Dwarf, and man. Khaine has spoken and he demands slaughter. To war!	true

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_main_final_battle_victory_skvcustom_quote	Ha! The treacherous wretches under the command of the Council of Thirteen run squealing before your triumphant horde, the musk of their terror heavy in the air. The attempt to double-cross and steal your glory has failed. The Great Vortex lies defenceless before you, its wards beaten down by the power of your final ritual. All is in place for the coming of the Great Horned Rat. The eternal glory will be yours, and yours alone. All Skavendom will remember your great name, the might of your armies, the subtlety of your schemes, the magnificence of your pelt! You shriek your triumph into the winds howling around the Vortex, and within that faltering construction a great shadowy form moves. Hunched and cloaked, still it towers over all, its horned head turning to survey your cowering servants, its clawed hands reaching for the veil separating it from this world. The Great Horned Rat is come in his full diabolical majesty and you, his favoured servant, wait to greet him and share in his victory.	true

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_dlc11_cst_cylostra_01custom_quote	Madame Cylostra is a vengeful spirit taught sea magic by Stromfels himself. If the tales hold true, she was once a Bretonnian songstress sent to sing for the Phoenix King, but a storm sank her ship and she drowned… unheard. Now her restless spirit is determined that the Elves will hear her sing even as she sinks Ulthuan. A comet in the heavens weakens the Vortex, awakening the sea-beast that slept beneath it. Should the Merwyrm be slain, then Madame-Captain Direfin can resurrect it using Undead allies, but first: a weapon to kill the beast. A harpoon fashioned by Captain Jacob Wulfhart lies at the bottom of the Great Ocean. All Cylostra need do is find it...	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_main_final_battle_victory_hefcustom_quote	Defeated by your heroic legions, the last of the treacherous Skaven host break and run, squealing in terror and thwarted rage, their scheme to subvert your final ritual to their own evil ends thwarted at the last. The Great Vortex hums softly, the sickly hues which had marred its currents dissipating, replaced instead with stronger, purer tones which speak of renewed strength. At the epicentre of the maelstrom, almost obscured by the mounting blaze of illumination, the ancient figure of Caledor slowly unbends, freed at last from his eternal, intolerable task of maintaining the great enchantment. Rising to his full height, he raises his hands and bathes in the light which now enfolds him in its nurturing glow. The light intensifies, and with a final faint smile of release the great Mage transcends, his essence becoming one with the Great Vortex, giving it a golden strength unbreakable.	true

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh_dlc03_bst_beastmen_khazrakcustom_quote	The Chaos Moon looms across the sky. It is a dark omen, a demand from the Ruinous Powers that the Cloven Ones rise up! They must emerge from their forest lairs and tear down the trappings of civilisation. Now is the Time of the Beast, and the Elector Counts - those of Todbringer's ilk - will pay in blood and the obliteration of their precious cities. And so the beast-path to destruction is paved with the bodies of men, of Dwarfs, and of Greenskins. 	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_dlc11_cst_noctilus_01custom_quote	From the depths emerges the Bloody Reaver, and upon its deck stands Count Noctilus. Formerly, he was Nyklaus von Carstein, but is now admiral of the Galleon’s Graveyard, who again senses an opportunity to rule the waves. The Vortex screams like a demented siren; a discordance caused by a rogue comet, waking a beast that sleeps beneath Ulthuan: the ancient Merwyrm. While it lives, the Elves believe it guards them, but should it be slain then it could be bound, for there are none more adept at controlling sea-monsters than Noctilus. But first it must die. The hunt for the Star-metal Harpoon begins…	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_main_skv_clan_mors_gccustom_quote	Clan Mors is ascendant! The most powerful clan of all is poised to execute its plan for total supremacy. In Skavenblight, Grand Warlord Gnawdwell makes his move, through fragile political alliances and flagrant assassination. Meanwhile, he sends his Right Paw, Queek Headtaker, to Karag Orrud, to bring all races under Mors' yoke. The slave tally will be great! Of course, if Queek fights all the battles and claims all the ruins, why should he be content merely to be Gnawdwell's servant? Surely, the title 'Warlord of all Skavendom' awaits the Headtaker?	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_dlc12_skv_ikit_claw_gccustom_quote	The Chief Warlock of Skryre is back in Skavenblight. Following another of his secret-stealing tours of the world, Ikit Claw has returned to be given the position of chief emissary of the clan. The bionic tinker-rat has only one plan on his mind, however – to bring an apocalypse to the world beyond Skavenblight’s swampy borders, aided by the most infernal custom-built weapons ever devised.	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_dlc11_cst_aranessa_01custom_quote	Aranessa Saltspite - daughter of Manann and one of the greatest pirate lords to ever stalk the oceans - is restless. The petty politics and cutthroat life amidst the broken docks of Sartosa no longer enthral the Queen of the Tides. Indeed, the Seafather himself has visited and decreed that she take control of all the world’s oceans. Such a task would take countless lifetimes, and so the currents wash many a dead corpse against the Swordfysh’s hull which the recently-recruited Vampire officers breathe Unlife into, creating a vast rabble of loyal crew, ready to serve at Captain Saltspite’s command.	true

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh_dlc03_bst_beastmen_malagorcustom_quote	The Chaos Moon looms across the sky. It is a dark omen, a demand from the Ruinous Powers that the Cloven Ones rise up! The Despoiler of the Sacred himself, Malagor, has made it to the long-ruined city of Mourkain, deep in the Badlands. He revels in its ruins, a glorious reminder of a sundered civilisation for those who would follow him, and what will come to pass should Malagor's desires be fulfilled. So begins the Crowfather's destructive path - something wicked is coming...   	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_main_final_battle_victory_def_morathicustom_quote	The defeated Skaven vermin run squealing before your exultant host, their treacherous attempt to subvert your plan crushed utterly. The Vortex lies defenceless before you, the wards guarding it overborne at last by your final ritual. Your laughter is a thing of malice and cold triumph. In aeons past you revelled in the violent excesses perpetrated by the Phoenix King Aenarion, your husband. Under your spell, the purity of this god-like lord was subverted and you manipulated him into ever greater follies on the path that eventually led to his doom. Malekith, the son that you made with Aenarion, is another great lord, but like his father he is also a slave to your manipulation. Through the power of the Great Vortex, you will raise him high, but you will be the true power, pulling the strings in the shadows and twisting all to your own ends. With a cruel smile, you beckon him toward the vortex and the power that awaits. And like the puppet he is, the Witch King steps forward to do your bidding.	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_dlc10_hef_alarielle_gccustom_quote	The world roils with war. Many in the Phoenix Court believe it is the Everqueen's sole duty to simply tour Avelorn and await Finubar's summons. But Alarielle is different from the Everqueens of old; if the kings and emperors of the world insist on unending war, then the Radiant will venture from Avelorn's borders to force peace upon all.

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh_dlc07_brt_bretonnia_louencustom_quote	Vampires, Greenskins and Beastmen alike are right to run from the field when King Louen Leoncoeur – ‘the Lionhearted’ – charges into the fray atop his noble Hippogryph Beaquis, for their doom is surely at hand! Wearing the blessed Crown of Bretonnia, and wielding the legendary Sword of Couronne – forged from exquisite Bretonnian silverine – the recently-crowned King Louen comes to smite evil from his lands with the eternal blessing of the Lady of the Lake!	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_dlc10_hef_alith_anar_01custom_quote	Let the twins seeks answers across the world or pontificate with Finubar in Lothern. Alith Anar has never answered to those two and he sees no reason why he should now. Yet, one thing is certain, Ulthuan is in danger: the Vortex is weakening. The Shadow King must remedy this to prevent a further Sundering. And all the while, in the north, the Sword of Khaine calls to his ice-cold heart... 	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_main_final_battle_victory_lzdcustom_quote	The Skaven host, the spawn of treachery, break and run, squealing before your stalwart legions, their schemes defeated utterly. The geomantic web hums with power, channelling the mighty will of the Slann Mage Priests into the Great Vortex. The great enchantment is the Elves’ mightiest work, yet what are they but a servant race? Small wonder that their work was flawed, and that enemies sought to exploit these flaws to imperil the world. All of this was written in the Old Ones’ Great Plan, and it was written too that it would fall to the first servants of the Old Ones, under your guiding hand, to conduct the Great Warding and thus bring order. The geomantic energy envelops the Vortex, correcting its wilder anomalies and anchoring its power for ever. Another step in the Great Plan is completed, and the powers of Chaos howl in fury in the void without.	true

If the twisted Beastlord's body is cut down, he is simply reborn elsewhere, draws a bray-herd to him, and the whole Ruinous cycle of madness and destruction begins anew. Only Queen Ariel of the Wood Elves truly understands that Morghur's evil is simply too powerful to be contained within a single corporeal form, and seeks a way to bring about his permanent destruction. Morghur cares not of this plan, for he seeks the very same for Athel Loren!	true

In the wake of Sotek’s forked tongue appearing in the sky, the fearless Tiktaq’to has been scrambled to fly across the World Pond to reclaim the lost temple-cities of the Southlands. Having observed the celestial event with concern, he now prepares to carry out his master's orders and concentrate his squadron’s efforts on re-establishing the Geomantic Web in the forsaken land.	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_dlc12_lzd_tehenhauin_01custom_quote	A migration of Red Crested Skinks has begun. With the Skaven launching new invasions upon Lustria and the Great Vortex weakening, the appearance of Sotek’s forked tongue in the sky heralds a time of great significance for the Lizardmen. In the far south of their home continent, the charismatic Prophet of Sotek readies his apostles for a purge of Lustria’s foes and to enact the next stage of the Great Plan.	true

The Grand Chieftain is charged with harvesting the abundant Warpstone deposits found there and establishing a strong tail-hold far from Clan Rictus’ primary lair at Crookback Mountain. It will be a difficult task, but one Tretch is more than capable of, for some whisper that this Skaven must hold the favour of the Horned Rat himself.	true

Once before Malekith took aim at the Vortex, the repercussions of which caused the Sundering. This time his mother, Morathi, has a plan. Although, she has been banished southwards while her son broods, it matters not; the Hag Sorceress will hunt out the Scrolls of Hekarti needed to enact a ritual that will see her kin dominant.	true

Ungrim Ironfist returns to the Slayer Keep, and with him come Runesmiths willing to share the rules of the runes. Let the forges fire, for a new era in Dwarfen artifice begins. And not a moment too soon, for the Age of Reckoning is under threat. Urki and grobi scum of the Red Eye Tribe threaten the sanctity of Karak Kadrin and the surrounding Dwarfholds. The Ancestor God, Grimnir, will surely demand their deaths, and the Slayer King has never shied from killing Greenskins!	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_lybaras_01custom_quote	Khalida ventures far from Lybaras. Her Liche Priests bring word that Vampires in Lustria seek the books of Nagash to claim the Black Pyramid. The Warrior-Queen cannot brook such a fate and so she has landed on the tip of Lustria, intending to locate the cursed tomes and claim the Pyramid for herself. However, the reptiles infesting this continent do not take kindly to Undead trespassers…	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh_dlc07_brt_bordeleaux_albericcustom_quote	The enemies of Duke Alberic of Bordeleaux are correct to shrink and run from his presence, for he is a mighty opponent – a Knight almost without equal who has never been bested on the field of battle by mortal adversary or unenchanted blade. As one of Bretonnia’s greatest exponents of lance and sword, he has on many occasions stood shoulder to shoulder with King Louen, facing down the forces of evil wherever they may be found in the name of his patron-god, Manann, and the Lady of the Lake!	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_followers_of_nagash_gccustom_quote	Arkhan the Black has spent millennia searching for the relics left behind by his master, Nagash. The hunt has not been in vain, however, for the time has come to unite these remnants of the Great Necromancer.

Even if this was not so, there is a dire threat growing in the north. It is clear that the Asur can no longer ignore goings-on beyond Ulthuan’s shores.

If the Druchii are to be the slave-masters of all, it is time for the Hag Sorceress to act. Morathi’s intrigues are deep and complex; oft-times her schemes run afoul of the Witch King’s own plans. For this, she and her rabid followers have been banished to the Ancient City of Quintex. Let her rivals think this a punishment - it is a move of Morathi’s own design, from where she can work her plans for world domination away from prying eyes.	true

Teclis' hopes of locating his followers and being left in peace are soon dashed, as others consider the High Loremaster’s seclusion a dire threat to their own plans. Reluctantly, it seems Teclis must fight to save the world.	true
custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh_dlc07_brt_carcassonne_faycustom_quote	Foes of all races, and even her own loyal Bretonnians, live in fear of the Fay Enchantress.

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh_dlc08_nor_norsca_gccustom_quote	For a God-cursed warrior with no home, every new land is fresh territory to be despoiled, every undefended shore an invitation to battle and plunder. Wulfrik the Wanderer waits at Icedrake Fjord, where Seafang sits uneasily at anchor, sails once filled with the Winds of Magic hanging slack, gore-infused timbers slapped by icy waves.

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh2_dlc11_cst_harkon_gccustom_quote	The Vampire Coast owes its name to Norscan raiders who attacked an Empire merchant ship and took everything of value from its holds. Unfortunately for the raiders, this included Luthor Harkon's sarcophagus. By the time the longship broke apart on the shores of Lustria, its crew had undergone a marked change in both allegiance and vital signs... Ever since, Harkon has dominated that part of Lustria and could have been a major force before now had his mind not been shattered by a powerful Old One hex. However, now Harkon's multiple personalities have finally aligned - Undead pirates flock to his flag and the armadas of the Vampire Coast prepare to sail the Great Ocean!	true
